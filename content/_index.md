This site hosts various work I do openly, with the intention of creating an easily accessible, free knowledge base. Although please do keep in mind that this site is not intended to be used as an authoritative information source such as [📖 Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org).

My biology work is not done here primarily, so it is copied up after being done in batches. This may result in significant delays.

Content on this site may not all be owned or produced by me, and is hosted here under fair use. If you have the rights to any content here and wish to have it altered or removed, then please contact me to request this.

The accuracy of the information on the site cannot be fully guaranteed. I do my best but as I am learning these subjects some inaccuracies are inevitable and may not be corrected. If you notice something, please let me know or submit a correction on GitHub. I will appreciate any feedback.

Lots of computer science content such as code is not hosted here, but may appear on source control occasionally. If there is demand for algorithms or code to be explained here, then I may consider including it in future.

## FAQ

### Does this website cover the whole A level spec for each subject?

No. Nor is it intended to. Chances are that by the time I have finished studying the course, it will cover *most* of the spec *for a specific exam board* per *subject*.

### Can I freely copy content from this website?

As the rights to content hosted here are not as straightforward as me being able to freely give everything away, I would strongly recommend you contact me before redistributing or modifying content.

### Can I use this to revise?

Yes, go for it. However, if something doesn't look right, challenge it. I would also strongly recommend combining this with other revision techniques, such as flash cards (see [🎴 Anki](https://ankiweb.net)). *I cannot guarantee the accuracy of any information provided here.*

### The website doesn't look like it is in sync with GitHub. Why?

GitHub changes are made in real time, however we only update the live website every hour. This can lead to some temporary discrepancies between the website and the source.

### Do you track me?

**TLDR;** Yes, but I take as many measures as possible to respect your privacy. For more details, see [🛡️ privacy](/privacy)

### What is biodiversity?

- Variety of organisms present in an area
- Species: a group of organisms with a very similar appearance, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and genetics. Can interbreed to produce fertile offspring.
- Habitat: a place where an organism lives
- Community: all the living organisms in a habitat

### Levels of Biodiversity

- Habitat: number of habitats in an area
- Species: 
	- Species Richness: number of species in an area
	- Species Evenness: number of each species
- Genetic Variety: variety of genes that make up a species (alleles)

### Why measure biodiversity?

- Important for conservation
- Required before a major project such as housing development

| **Habitat Feature**               | **Low biodiversity**           | **High Biodiversity**                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Number of species                 | few                            | many                                     |
| Ability to adapt to environment   | little                         | greater                                  |
| Type of food webs                 | few links, each very important | many links, each with reduced importance |
| Effect of a change in environment | Catastrophic                   | Negligible                               |

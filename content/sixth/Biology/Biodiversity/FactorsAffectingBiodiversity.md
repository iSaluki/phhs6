### Factors affecting biodiversity

- Deforestation: reduces the number of trees which in turn reduces the number of animals due to habitat and food loss. Some animals are forced to migrate.
- Agriculture: clearing land to rear/grow animals 
	- removal of hedgerows
	- use of pesticides/herbicides
	- monoculture
- Climate: melting of polar ice caps
	- rising sea levels (flooding, salt water)
	- higher temperatures
	- less rainfall
	- insect lifecycles, pollination

### Reasons to maintain biodiversity


| **Reason** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Aesthetic  | - encriches life - allows faster recovery - provides inspiration                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Economic   | - deforestation can lead to soil erosion, causing desertification and loss of fertile land - non-sustainable removal leads to industry collapse - massive destruction - leads to important species going extinct before discovery - high diversity leads to increased tourism |
| Ecological | - all organisms are interdependent upon each other - some species are invoilved in maintaining the whole ecosystem                                                                                                                                                            |

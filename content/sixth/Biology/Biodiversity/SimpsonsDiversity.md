- Measure of diversity in a habitat
- Accounts for species richness and eveness
- *n* = number of individuals of each species
- *N* = total number of individuals of all species

- high value = diverse habitat 
	- environmental change may only affect 1 or 2 species
- low value = habitat dominated by a few species
	- small environmental change could affect whole habitat

#### Example


| **Species** | **n** | **n/N** | **n/N‚ÇÇ** |
|-------------|-------|---------|----------|
| woodlouse   | 22    | 0.289   | 0.0838   |
| mouse       | 5     | 0.0658  | 0.004    |
| shrew       | 7     | 0.0131  | 0.0002   |
| earthworm   | 32    | 0.421   | 0.177    |
| grasshopper | 15    | 0.197   | 0.039    |
| owl         | 1     | 0.0131  | 0.0002   |
| **TOTAL**   | N: 76 | -       | ùù® 0.304  |

Simpson's Diversity = 1-0.304 = **0.696**

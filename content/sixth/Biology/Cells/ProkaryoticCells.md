## Endosymbiosis

Endosymbiosis is the theory that a larger cell engulfed bacteria with energy producing capabilitiesâ€”eventually becoming chloroplasts and mitochondria.

Evidence includes mitochondria and chloroplasts dividing like bacteria; have individual DNA; dividing independently of the cell

## Gram Staining
Microscopy stain to help identify different bacteria.

### Gram Positive Bacteria
- Colour: blue
- More peptidoglycan

### Gram Negative Bacteria
- Colour: red
- Less peptidoglycan

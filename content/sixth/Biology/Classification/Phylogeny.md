- The study of evolutionary relationships between species. Involves studying how closely different species are related.
- Any 2 living organisms have a common ancestor at some point in the past.
- The more recent the common ancestor, the more closely related they are.

- Natural classification places similar species in a group
- Any two living organisms have a common ancestor
- When species started to evolve differently there are branch points or nodes on the tree
- More recent common ancestors mean closer relations.

| **Genetic cause of variation** | **What happens?**                                                                                                                                                  | **Why does it cause variation?**                                           | **Example?**                       |

| Alleles                        | Different versions of genes                                                                                                                                        | Produces different proteins and therefore different structures and effects | Blood group                        |
| Mutations                      | Mistake in DNA                                                                                                                                                     | Changes in protein that are coded for                                      | Cystic fibrosis                    |
| Meiosis                        | Gametes form which have half the genetic material of parent cells. Crossing over and independent assortment also occur to make every gamete genetically different. | Different gametes have different mix of alleles                            | Variation in gametes               |
| Sexual reproduction            | Inherit genes from both parents                                                                                                                                    | Individual produced is genetically different from parents                  | Children                           |
| Chance                         | Chance which gametes fertilise                                                                                                                                     | Unique combination of genetic material for each offspring                  | Siblings different from each other |

### Environmental Causes of Variation

| **Environmental cause of variation** | **What happens?**                                                                                                                                     | **Why does it cause variation?**                                                                                                                 | **Example?**                                                                                         |

| Conditions for plant                 | Plants in different conditions grow to different sizes  Plants in different pH soils can grow different coloured flowers  Lack of nutrients for plant | More sunlight for photosynthesis to make glucose for respiration and growth  Acidic soil makes blue flowers. Alkali makes pink flowers  Proteins | Rose bush in higher light intensity grows bigger  Different coloured flowers of hydrangeas  Nitrates |
| Injury/Disease                       | Damaged tissue                                                                                                                                        | Damages cell, leaves marks on skin                                                                                                               | Scars                                                                                                |

### Combined Environmental and Genetic Causes of Variation

| Height                                            | Inherited genes from parents     | Malnourishment                           |
| Skin colour                                       | Genes instruct melanin levels    | Sunlight can increase melanin production |

### Discrete Variation

- Discontinuous/discrete variation is normally only controlled by a single gene (or very few).
- There are no in-between values, only specific ones.
- Normally represented through a bar chart.

### Continuous variation

- A characteristic that can take any value in a range (quantitative) is said to show continuous variation.
- Characteristics that show continuous variation such as height show a normal distribution pattern
- These characteristics are usually controlled by a number of genes (polygenic) and influenced by the environment

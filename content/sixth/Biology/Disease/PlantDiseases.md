## Transmission

### Direct Transmission

- Direct contact between plants

### Indirect Transmission

- Via soil or vectors such as air
- Pathogens may survive in soil and affect future plants (soil contamination)
- Additional vectors include:
	- Wind
	- Water (raindrops, splashes etc)
	- Animals, insects and birds
	- Humans, hands, clothing and tools

## Global Transmission Factors

- Some varieties of crops are more susceptible than others
- Overcrowding
- Poor mineral nutrition reduces diseases resistance
- Damp, warm conditions increase spread of pathogens
- Climate change

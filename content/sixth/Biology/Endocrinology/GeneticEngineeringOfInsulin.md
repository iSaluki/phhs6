### Procedure

1) Cut out gene for insulin from DNA
2) Insert into plasmid to make **recombinant DNA**
3) Insert into bacteria (*E.coli*)
4) Bacteria produce insulin
5) Purify insulin

### Stem Cell Treatment

- Undifferentiated cells that can become any cell type
- Differentiated cells have genes switched on or off in a sequence
- Stem cells could be made to turn into β-cells which would respond to high levels of blood glucose by secreting insulin

This treatment is difficult because:

- immune system may reject transplanted β-cells
- large volumes of β-cells required

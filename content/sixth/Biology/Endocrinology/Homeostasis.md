- Living things have an internal environment 
	- the environment changing puts stress on the organism
	- organisms need to maintain specific conditions
	- a stimulus invokes a response

- Internal Environments:
	- If an organism is multicellular many cells are not exposed externally 
	- protected by skin/bark and bathed in tissue fluid
	- Waste products diffuse from cells 
		- Accumulation of waste is a stimulus
		- Cells need to respond
		- Waste needs to be removed
		- Wast enters the blood and is carried away 
		- Blood concentrations must be closely monitored


- A good communication system needs: 
	- To cover the whole body
	- To allow cells to communicate
	- To allow specific communication
	- To allow rapid communication
	- To enable short and long term responses

### Negative feedback

- A change to an internal environment is detected
- Change is signalled to other cells
- A response is invoked to reverse the change

Negative feedback requires:
- receptors
- communications system 
- effector cells
- conditions fluctuate around a set point

### Positive feedback

- Less common
- Increases the original change
- Useful sometimes

- Oxytocin increases uterus contractions


#### Temperature Control

##### Ectotherms

- Animals that use their surroundings to warm their bodies


| **Advantages**                       | **Disadvantages**                          |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Less energy required                 | Requires ideal environment                 |
| Less food needed                     | Requires basking                           |
| No thermoregulatory functions needed | May not be capable of activity over winter |
| Can go longer without food           |                                            |
| More energy used for growth          |                                            |

Temperature regulation in ectotherms:
- Exposed body to the sun
	- increases temperature
- Increase breathing movements
	- reduces temperature
- Orientate body away from sun
	- reduces temperature
- Hide in burrow
	- reduce temperature
- Orientate to sun
	- increases temperature
- Alter body shape
	- increases temperature
- Change heart rate
	- Increase or decrease

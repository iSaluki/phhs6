### Co-factors

- Non-protein components
- Bind temporarily
- Obtained from diet (iron ions, calcium ions etc)
- eg, amylase requires Cl‚Åª to function

### Co-enzymes

- An organic (carbon-based) co-factor
- Bind temporarily
- Many derived from vitamins
- Carry chemicals between enzymes

### Prosthetic Groups

- Bind permanently
- Eg haem in haemoglobin


### Activation of Enzymes

- many enzymes are inactive to begin with
- need a change in 3D structure to activate
- Some activated by co-factors, some a change in environment (pH/temperature)

Alveoli are the sole site of gaseous exchange.

## Adaptations for gaseous exchange

> [!abstract] Gaseous Exchange
>
> movement of gases by diffusion between an organism and its environment.

- large surface area : many alveoli
- short distance for diffusion: alveoli and capillary wall are one cell thick (squamous epithelium)
- steep diffusion gradient: ventilation and good bloody supply
- semi-permeable membrane: cell membranes are permeable to oxygen and carbon dioxide

## Alveoli

![[sixth/Biology/ExchangeSurfaces/img/Pasted image 20221019121914.png]]
Blue blood is arriving to be oxygenated and red blood is leaving after being oxygenated.

Alveoli have thin walls and provide large surface areas for gas exchange.

## Tissue and function distribution in the human lungs

### Requirements of human airways
- flexible
- divide many times, allow air to reach alveoli
- high elasticity (stretch & recoil)
- strong, to prevent collapse

## Components

### Trachea
- much of the wall is cartilage
- prevents collapse when air pressure is low
- Contains:
	- elastic fibres: recoil & return
	- smooth muscles: constrict airway
	- blood vessels: supply cells with nutrients and remove waste
- Innermost lining is epithelium (ciliated and goblet cells)

### Bronchi
- Same as trachea, just smaller

### Bronchioles
- Larger ones may have some cartilage
- Mainly smooth muscle and elastic fibres

### Alveoli
- Squamous epithelium 
- elastic fibres: recoil after exhalation to prevent bursting

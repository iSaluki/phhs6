title: Reading about Photosynthesis
---
### Part 1

1) Name 3 pigments in leaves
   - Chlorophyll a
   - Chlorophyll b
   - Carotenoid
2) What are two products of the Light dependent reaction?
   - Electrons
  - Oxygen
3) What does an absorption spectrum show?
  Light absorption of a pigment at a range of frequencies of light wavelength
4) Where does the light dependent reaction occur?
   Photosystem II, and partially in Photosystem I
5) What is the role of light harvesting pigments?
   To absorb as much light energy as possible. This is achieved by using a range of pigments that can absorb different frequencies of light.
6) What is the role of the reaction centre of a photosystem?
   To pass excited electrons down the electron transport chain
7) What happens to electrons in the reaction centre?
   They have their energy level increased via photon energy.
8) How is the electron from chlorophyll p680 replaced?
   A water molecule is split 
9) Which type of chlorophyll is in photosystem I?
   P700
10) What is chemiosmosis?
    The process of producing ATP in ATP synthase

### Part 2

- Produce 10 short answer questions with answers

1) What is the maximum depth seaweed can grow at in clear water? 
   - 250 meters
2) When do seaweeds release carbon dioxide?
   - At night or during low light levels
3) How does seaweed protect itself from dangerous wavelengths?
   - They have specialised pigments
4) Do macroalgae have roots or stems?
   - Neither, all the nutrients they need can be found dissolved in the seawater. 
5) What is an important limiting factor for the growth of green algae?
   - Nitrogen access
6) Do seaweeds need differentiated cells? 
   - Not always, as tissues can usually draw everything they need from the surrounding water.
7) What makes up optimal conditions for seaweed?
   - A correct balance of substrate, nutritional elements, temperature and light
8) Does marine algae have any interesting nutritional information?
   - It contains more iron than spinach or egg yolks
9) How deep can you find red macroalgae?
   - Down to about 30 meters, beyond which you get brown and above which you are more likely to get green
10) Can seaweed still perform photosynthesis when exposed to air?
    - Partially

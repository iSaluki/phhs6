### Bond energy

- The same quantity of energy is involved when a particular bond is being broken or formed.
- The atoms in small inorganic molecules like water and carbon dioxide are joined by strong bonds, meaning that they require a lot of energy to break and release a lot when they form. 
- Organic molecules like glucose contain many more bonds; these are weaker by comparison.
- They release less energy when they form and require less energy to be broken.

### Equation

6CO₂ + 6H₂O -> C₆H₁₂O₆+6O₂

### Autotrophs and Heterotrophs

- Autotrophs such as plants can synthesise complex organic molecules such as carohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids and vitamins from simple inorganic molecules like CO₂ and energy sources.
- Organisms that can photosynthesise are described as photoautotrophs

### Chemoautotrophs

- Nitrifying bacteria -> get energy from reactions such as oxidising nitrite to nitrate
- Bacteria living in darkness by thermal ocean vents

### Heterotrophs

- Cannot make their own complex organic molecules from inorganic small molecules like CO₂ and H₂O but feed on and digest complex organic molecules into simpler soluble ones.

### Chloroplasts

- 2-10 µm in length
- Usually disk shaped (sometimes varying)
- Surrounded by an envelope or double membrane
- Outer membrane is permeable to many small ions
- The inner membrane is less permeable and has embedded in it folded into **llamellae** (thin plates) which are stacked vertically. Each stack is called a **granum**.
- Between grana are **integranal llamellae**

### Photosynthetic Pigments

- Absorb certain wavelengths of light
- Funnel-shaped structures called photostems push light to a point
- Proteins embedded in grana hold photostems in place
- The fluid-filled stroma contains enzymes needed to catalyse reactions of the light-dependent stage of photosynthesis
- Many grana, consisting of stacks of 100 **thylakoid membranes** provides a large surface area for the photosynthetic protein.
- Grana surrounded by stroma so products of the light-dependent reaction (needed for light-independent reaction) can readily pass into stroma.
- LIR - light independent reaction
- LDR - light dependent reaction
- Chloroplasts can make some of their proteins they need for photosynthesis using genetic instructions in chloroplast DNA, and the chloroplast ribosomes assemble the proteins.

- Leaves contain a variety of pigments 
- Each absorbs a different range of light wavelengths
- Maximises the amount of sunlight that can be absorbed

**Leaders**: Inspire people, build relationships, take risks and have followers.

**Managers**: Enact the plan, use their authority, manage risks, have subordinates

Both are closely linked and one person may have to do both roles.

> Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things - **Peter Drucker**

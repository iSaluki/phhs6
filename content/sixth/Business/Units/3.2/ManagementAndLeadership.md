## Leadership Skills

- Confidence (Laissez-faire)
- Perserverance 
- Decisive
- Caring (Paternalistic)
- Discipline (Authoirtarian)
- Intelligence (EQ/IQ)
- And many others

Different kinds of leader [(leadership styles)](sixth/Business/Units/3.2/LeadershipStyles) will show different leadership skills to complement their style.

The traditional view of good leadership (Victorian) is that you will take *Command and Control* and be good at *Decision-making*. However, the more modern view is that a leader will:

- inspire employees
- create a vision
- shape core values and culture
- build effective teams


## Tannenbaum and Schmidt

A "continuum of leadership" that goes from complete authoritarianism to laissez-faire. 

As you move along the continuum, it moves from the manager telling staff what to do to, them selling the idea and then the next section is consulting. When a manager asks employees about a decision for advice. The final stage is join - where the group makes a decision.

The extremes of the spectrum are Manager-centered leadership and subordinate centered leadership.

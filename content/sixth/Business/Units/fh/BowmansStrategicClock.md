### Challenge of Business Strategy

- To find a way of achieving a sustainable competitive advantage over the other competing products and firms in a market

### A competitive advantage

- An advantage over competitors gained by offering consumers greater value, either by means of lower prices or by providing greater benefits and service that justifies higher prices

### Low price

- Low profit margins
- Companies such as Aldi
- Very intense (price wars)

### Low price and low value

- Not very competitive
- Very little value

### Hybrid

- Some element of low price
- Some product differentiation
- Some added value and a reasonable price 

### Differentiation

- Offers the highest level of perceived added value
- Branding plays a key role
- Quality is very important

### Focused Differentiation

- Highest price levels
- Customers buy the product because of the high perceived value
- Luxury brand

### Risky High Margins

- Very high risk
- No extra in terms of perceived value
- Customers will usually find a better option eventually
- Very short term strategy

### Monopoly Pricing

- Only one business offering the product
- Customers have no alternative, so pricing is easy to change for the business
- Regulated very tightly as the market position is extremely dominant

### Loss of market share

- Recipe for disaster
- Middle-range or standard price for a product with a low perceived value

## Differences between
### The mission of a business and the objectives of a business

- A mission is typically higher level than an objective and viewed on a longer term by a business. An objective might be to increase profit of a certain market area by 25% over a period of time, whilst the mission might be to bring affordable clothing to everyone.

###  Private and public limited companies

- The shares of a private limited company are not floated on the stock market
- A public limited company requires at least Â£50,000 in capital to launch
- Many companies start private and go public
- Public companies have additional reporting requirements

### Limited and Unlimited Liability

- Limited liability means that shareholders are not responsible for the debts of the business
- Whilst unlimited liability means any debts that the business has are shared between shareholders should they need to be collected
- Limited liability is much safer from a legal viewpoint

### The objectives of a sole trader and the objectives of a public limited company

- A sole trader is likely looking to make a living by selling goods or services in a single location, with only several employees
- Public limited companies have much larger and broader objectives, as they will typically try to achieve societal changes and will operate on a larger scale with a significantly larger amount of capital.

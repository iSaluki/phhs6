### Analyse the consequences to Dandy Longlegs of recruiting new sales staff on flexible contracts (12 marks)

Sales staff are very important for the business revenue, as they are going to provide the customer-facing experience and will in many cases be the difference between a sale being made or not. By placing staff on flexible contracts, their motivation might be lessened as they will be focused on finding another job and will not feel a connection to the business. However, this will also provide the business with greater flexibility and the option to quickly and legally remove under-performing staff, as well as the flexibility to let people go without making redundancies.

As staff require training and have recruitment costs, a high rate of turnover (which will be exacerbated by temporary contracts) will be costly for the business in terms of efficiency and apparent competency. Instead, it might make sense for the business to focus on increasing retention of staff and reducing absenteeism. This could include initiatives such as offering more flexible hours to staff or providing higher pay/benefits.

Whilst managers are definitely required in retail stores, they are not needed in large numbers and could likely straddle the responsibilities of several departments.

### Analyse the strategic position of Frozen World through either the model of Porter's generic strategies or Bowman's strategic clock (12 marks)

Frozen World have positioned themselves with very low prices to ensure that they can attract customers on price alone. By using Cost Leadership, they sacrifice higher end market sales and focus on volume of goods sold. In order to make this work, they focus on economies of scale to allow bulk purchases to be made and low unit costs to be achieved. Frozen World also benefits from the declining UK economy, as more people are struggling to afford essentials such as food, which makes Frozen World more attractive to potential customers. They further reduce their costs by selling unbranded goods, because known brand names automatically inflate costs. In the case of Frozen World, they don't care particularly about brands or quality as they have put their entire focus into price.

They have placed themselves at position 1 on Bowman's Strategic Clock, providing low prices with low added value. They don't add any value particularly, but their USP is having the lowest prices, which is enough to generate sales. When they made the decision to position themselves here, they sacrificed a lot of potential customers who would look for higher quality products, more socially impactful businesses, in favour of being the cheapest.

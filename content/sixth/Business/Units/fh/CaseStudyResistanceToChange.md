1) Identify three driving forces and three restraining forces in systems that management at Rockcliffe Marketing Consultancy wish to introduce
   
   - Driving
	   - Marketing Systems are outdated and need modernising
	   - Managers are very enthusiastic about a new system
	   - Managers need to make change to meet profit objectives and prevent job losses
   - Restraining
	   - Marketing executives need to learn how to use a new computer system
	   - Marketing executives are not keen
	   - Marketing executives have a lot of clout

2) Analyse the types of actions that management might take to either strengthen the driving forces or weaken the restraining forces.

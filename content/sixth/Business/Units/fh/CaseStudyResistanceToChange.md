1) Identify three driving forces and three restraining forces in systems that management at Rockcliffe Marketing Consultancy wish to introduce
   
   - Driving
	   - Marketing Systems are outdated and need modernising
	   - Managers are very enthusiastic about a new system
	   - Managers need to make change to meet profit objectives and prevent job losses
   - Restraining
	   - Marketing executives need to learn how to use a new computer system
	   - Marketing executives are not keen
	   - Marketing executives have a lot of clout
	   - Training is costly

2) Analyse the types of actions that management might take to either strengthen the driving forces or weaken the restraining forces.
   
   - Management could utilise techniques such as education and communication to try and inform the resisting marketing executives and persuade them that the changes are a good thing in the long run.
   - If more gentle/amicable methods are ineffective, then more harsh measures could be taken. Managers are aware that job cuts are a risk if this change does not go through, so they could make this clear to marketing executives to motivate them to accept the change.
   - The learning for the new software is a temporary commitment, and time off is being offered to complete it. This is a reasonable move by managers that should hopefully bring marketing executives to the table at the very least.

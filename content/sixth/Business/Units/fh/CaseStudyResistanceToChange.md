1) Identify three driving forces and three restraining forces in systems that management at Rockcliffe Marketing Consultancy wish to introduce
   
   - Driving
	   - Marketing Systems are outdated and need modernising
	   - Managers are very enthusiastic about a new system
	   - Managers need to make change to meet profit objectives and prevent job losses
   - Restraining
	   - Marketing executives need to learn how to use a new computer system
	   - Marketing executives are not keen
	   - Marketing executives have a lot of clout
	   - Training is costly

2) Analyse the types of actions that management might take to either strengthen the driving forces or weaken the restraining forces.
   
   - Management could utilise techniques such as education and communication to try and inform the resisting marketing executives and persuade them that the changes are a good thing in the long run.
   - If more gentle/amicable methods are ineffective, then more harsh measures could be taken. Managers are aware that job cuts are a risk if this change does not go through, so they could make this clear to marketing executives to motivate them to accept the change.
   - The learning for the new software is a temporary commitment, and time off is being offered to complete it. This is a reasonable move by managers that should hopefully bring marketing executives to the table at the very least.

1) Assess the various causes of, and pressures for, change and how these contribute to the value of change for an organisation.
   
   Change is an inevitability for any organisation that wants to survive. However, the pressures for and against changes are highly fluid and dependent upon the specifics of each change. Regardless, all changes are characterised by a few similar factors. Typically, you could expect the employees to generate a resisting factor and the managers to generate a driving factor. A change is usually required to safeguard the future of the business, yet it might be made at the expense of those who work there. Employees typically like to have a routine and a way of doing things - change disrupts this and causes dissatisfaction. Dissatisfaction is bad for the productivity of a business so managers aim to avoid or minimise it where possible, but in some cases this may not be possible as a change may be strongly contested but still required.

**A core competence is something unique that a business has, or can do, strategically well.**

The concept was developed by Prahalad & Hamel

"The key to competing in the future is building, deploying, protecting and defending core competencies..."

When linked to [SWOT Analysis](sixth/Business/Units/fh/SWOTAnalysis), core competencies are a strength

### The Three Key Conditions

If a quality meets all three conditions, then it is a core competency.

- Does it provide consumer benefits?
- Is it easy for competitors to imitate? (NO)
- Can it be leveraged widely to many products and markets?

### Prahalad & Hamel's suggest

- Outsource areas that you don't specialise in 
- Focus on the core competencies

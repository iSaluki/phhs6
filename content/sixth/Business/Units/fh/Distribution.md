- Buy large volumes of products at a low price and resell smaller quantities at a slightly higher (but still cheaper than the market) price
- Retailers can order smaller amounts of product from wholesalers.
- A wholesaler makes money by buying at a lower price from the producer and adding their profit margin onto the price paid by the retailer.

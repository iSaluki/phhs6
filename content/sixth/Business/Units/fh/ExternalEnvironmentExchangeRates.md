### Practice exercise 4

#### What is an exchange rate?

- The amount of one currency that can be purchased for another currency.


#### Explain how free exchange rates are determined.

- If the demand for payments in one currency increases, then the value of that currency would increase, whilst the opposite is also true.

#### State and explain three reasons why a currency might increase in value

- Higher demand for exports
	- If one country has highly desired export demands then their currency is likely to increase in value
- Trader speculation
	- If traders believe that the value will increase, then they will buy the currency up and that will lead to an increase in value
- Foreign investment
	- Foreign investments into the country leads to greater demand

#### Select one of the following statements to complete the sentence...

- If the value of the pound against the dollar rises, then prices of exports to America rise and prices of imports from America fall.
- if the value of the pound against the dollar falls, then prices of export to America fall and prices of imports from America rise.

#### When the exchange rate rises

##### How might a firm ensure that its prices abroad do not rise?

- They could use local suppliers as much as possible, reducing the impact as much as they can on tariffs and exchange rate fluctuations. 

##### Why might a firm not always choose to take the above action?
- It might not be viable for a firm to get a certain material locally, as it may either be much cheaper to import from an external supplier or it may be a natural resource that can only be extracted in certain regions, outside of the country.

- A flexible organisation is one that is able to adapt and respond relatively quickly to changes in its external environment in order to gain advantage and sustain its competitive position

### Restructuring

- A key feature of most flexible organisations is the shift that has taken place in the structure of the workforce.
- Core workers - permanent, full time, salaried, central to the organisation and likely to be committed to the aims and objectives of the organisation
- Peripheral, temporary or part-time workers, less secure, easy to replace, less likely to be committed to the organisation's aims and objectives

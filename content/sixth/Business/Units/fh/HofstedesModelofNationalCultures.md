- Hofstede carried out research of over 100,000 employees at IBM in different countries around the world
- Attempted to categorise cultures of different nationalities working at IBM
- His research suggests that cultural differences matter especially in those international organisations where the culture of the country is more important in the manager's decision making than the firm's culture. If you understand this then international business ventures are more likely to be successful.

- A model of cultural dimensions that distinguish one country's culture from another
- The model measures and compares cultural dimensions of different countries and demonstrates that there are national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behaviour of organisations.

### What distinguishes different cultures?

- Individualism vs Collectivism
	- Some cultures prioritise individuals, whilst others prioritise family and teams.
- Power Distance
	- The gap between the boss and the employees. In some cultures, a boss is friends with employees and there is a small power distance. However in others a boss is a much more imperialistic figure with a much sharper structure and larger power distance.
- Short-termism vs Long-termism
	- Some cultures want instant change to justify any action, whilst others are willing to appreciate long-term investments.
- Masculinity vs Feminity
	- There is a divide between equal treatment in different countries around the world and a business needs to figure out how to handle each.
- Uncertainty Avoidance
	- Some cultures are unwilling to take unnecessary risks while others are more willing to go for it.
- Indulgence vs Restraint
	- Relation between gratification and control. Indulgence is freedom of speech and leisure as priorities whilst restraint sees these with lower importance. Indulgence tends to be more prevalent in the Americas and Europe.

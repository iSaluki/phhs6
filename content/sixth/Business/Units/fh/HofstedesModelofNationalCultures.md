- Hofstede carried out research of over 100,000 employees at IBM in different countries around the world
- Attempted to categorise cultures of different nationalities working at IBM
- His research suggests that cultural differences matter especially in those international organisations where the culture of the country is more important in the manager's decision making than the firm's culture. If you understand this then international business ventures are more likely to be successful.

- A model of cultural dimensions that distinguish one country's culture from another
- The model measures and compares cultural dimensions of different countries and demonstrates that there are national and regional cultural groupings that affect the behaviour of organisations.

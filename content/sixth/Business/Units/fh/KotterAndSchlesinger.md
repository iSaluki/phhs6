### Kotter and Schlesigner's four reasons for resistance to change

- Parochial self interest
	- Individuals are concerned with the implications for themselves
- Misunderstanding
	- Communications problems
	- Inadequate information
- Low tolerance of change
	- Sense of insecurity
- Different assessment of the situation
	- Disagreement over the need for change
	- Disagreement over the advantages and disadvantages

### Inappropriate change management

- Change is often resisted because of failures in the way it is introduced
	- Explain the need for change
	- Provide information
	- Consult, negotiate and offer support and training
	- Involve people in the process
	- Build trust and sense of security
	- Build employee relations

### Six ways to overcome resistance to change

- Education and communication
	- This can involve one-to-one discussions, presentations to groups of memos based on reports. Usually an appropriate approach when resistance is based on inadequate or inaccurate information.
- Participation and involvement
	- This approach is useful when the initiators of change do not have all the information they need to design changes effectively, and the information, knowledge and skills that others have can be used positively for the change process rather than as a source of resistance.
- Facilitation and support
	- This involves providing emotional and material support to help people deal with this anxiety and uncertainty ("adjustment problems"). This process would likely involve training.
- Negotiation and agreement
	- Involves giving resistors incentives to either adapt or leave an organisation. This might involve agreeing to certain demands or adjusting plans. It could involve increasing costs by raising wages.
- Manipulation and co-optation
	- Co-opting an individual, or the leader of a group, involves giving them a desirable role in the design or implementation of the change. Co-optation can sometimes be a relatively inexpensive way of gaining an individual or organisation's support.
- Explicit and implicit coercion
	- Managers can force employees into accepting change by suggesting that resisting change can lead to negative outcomes such as job loss. If this is explicit they will be told directly, whereas implicit will merely suggest the outcome.

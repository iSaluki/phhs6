> The way we do things around here

- Organisational culture refers to
	- values
	- attitudes
	- beliefs
- of an organisation's employees
- Culture is built up slowly over a long period of time and it will be different in every organisation

- Culture consists of
	- shared values of a business
	- beliefs and norms that affect every aspect of work life
	- the behaviours that are typical of day-to-day behaviour
	- the strength of a culture determines how difficult or easy it is to know how to behave in the business
### Factors Influencing Culture of an Organisation

- Influence of the founder (shadow of the leader)
- Size and development stage of the business (eg, start-up, multisite, multinational)
- Leadership & management style
- Organisational structure, policies & practices
### Ways of Identifying Culture Within an Organisation

- Company Rituals
	- Celebrating a birthday
- Reward systems
	- Are employees still rewarded for acting in an unethical manner?
	- Are staff rewarded for high sales or happy customers?
- Physical environment
	- What pictures hang on the walls?
	- How much investment do facilities receive?
### How culture might be demonstrated

> The way we do things around here

- Organisational culture refers to
	- values
	- attitudes
	- beliefs
- of an organisation's employees
- Culture is built up slowly over a long period of time and it will be different in every organisation

- Culture consists of
	- shared values of a business
	- beliefs and norms that affect every aspect of work life
	- the behaviours that are typical of day-to-day behaviour
	- the strength of a culture determines how difficult or easy it is to know how to behave in the business

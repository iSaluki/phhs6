> The way we do things around here

- Organisational culture refers to
	- values
	- attitudes
	- beliefs
- of an organisation's employees
- Culture is built up slowly over a long period of time and it will be different in every organisation

- Culture consists of
	- shared values of a business
	- beliefs and norms that affect every aspect of work life
	- the behaviours that are typical of day-to-day behaviour
	- the strength of a culture determines how difficult or easy it is to know how to behave in the business
### Factors Influencing Culture of an Organisation

- Influence of the founder (shadow of the leader)
- Size and development stage of the business (eg, start-up, multisite, multinational)
- Leadership & management style
- Organisational structure, policies & practices
### Ways of Identifying Culture Within an Organisation

- Company Rituals
	- Celebrating a birthday
- Reward systems
	- Are employees still rewarded for acting in an unethical manner?
	- Are staff rewarded for high sales or happy customers?
- Physical environment
	- What pictures hang on the walls?
	- How much investment do facilities receive?
### How culture might be demonstrated

- How employees are recruited
- The way that visitors and guests are looked after
- How the working space is organised
- The degree of delegation & individual responsibility
- How contracts are negotiated and agreed
- The personality and style of the sales force
- The responsiveness of communication
- The methods used for communication
- How staff call each other

### Strong or Weak

#### Strong

- Staff understand and respond to culture
- Little need for policies and procedures
- Consistent behaviour
- Culture is embedded

#### Weak

- Little alignment with business values
- Inconsistent behaviour
- A need for extensive bureaucracy & procedures

### Culture: Strong or Weak?

- A firm's cultural hold over their employees can be either strong or relatively weak
- A strong culture is where employees agree with the firm's corporate values and are committed to helping the firm in the long-term. Such staff are loyal and hence turnover is low.


### Handy's Four Types of Culture

- Charles Handy devised a model which identified four distinct types of culture that might exist within an organisation
- This theory explores classifications of business structures and organisation based upon the functions and roles of the individual.

- Power
	- Power radiates from a few individuals
	- Found in entrepreneurial organisations
	- Few rules/little bureaucracy
	- Swift decision making
- Role
	- People clearly delegated authorities
	- Highly defined structure role 
	- Typically tall detailed organisational structure
	- Decision making slow
- Task
	- Teams are formed to solve particular problems
	- Power derives from expertise as long as a team requires expertise
	- No single power source
	- Matrix organisation
	- Team may develop own objectives (potential risk)
- Person
	- People believe they are superior to the organisation
	- Common in professionals
	- Success depends on retaining key personnel

| Role          | Autocratic or paternalistic |
| Task          | Paternalistic/democratic    |
| Person        | Democratic                  |

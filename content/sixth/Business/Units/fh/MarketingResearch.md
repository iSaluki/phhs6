- the benefits they want
- amount they are able to or willing to pay
- media (television, newspapers, websites and magazines) they see/use
- quantities they buy
- time and place that they buy

Insights provided by effective market research:
- dimensions of the market (Size, structure, growth, trends)
- competitor strategies
- needs, wants and expectations of customers
- market segments

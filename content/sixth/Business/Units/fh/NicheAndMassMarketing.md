**Niche Marketing:** Where a business targets a smaller segment of a larger market, where customers have specific needs and wants.

**Mass Marketing:** Where a business sells into the largest part of the market, where there are many similar products offered by competitors.

## Niche Marketing

| Pros?                           | Why?                                                                                                       | Cons                                        | Why?                                                                                                                                                   |

| Profit margins often higher     | Lower sales required to cover costs                                                                        | Lack of economies of scale                  | Demand will be relatively low, so manufacturing will have to happen in smaller batches                                                                 |
| Clear focus                     | Because they are targeting a niche market, they know exactly what customers want.                          | If successful likely to attract competition | Other businesses will be interested to expand their market share, because it would lead to greater income.                                             |
| Less competition                | A smaller market segment means less businesses will be competing for the custom.                           | Vulnerable to market change                 | Because the targeted market is so small, any small change could severely impact the revenue of the company.                                            |
| Customers tend to be more loyal | Because you are tailoring your product or service to them specifically, customers will feel a closer bond. | Risk of overdependence on a single market   | Targeting a niche market means that a very small group of people will be customers, so the company will  be a lot more dependant on a few individuals. |

## Mass Marketing

| Pros?                    | Why?                                                                           | Cons                                          | Why?                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Higher sales             | Larger market, more people looking to buy, more sales                          | Can be difficult to meet all customer demands | You're targeting a large market segment, meaning that you're making a one size fits all solution.                                        |
| Higher brand awareness   | More people are interested in the product, so more people will be aware of it  | Higher advertising costs                      | More people need to see the advert because the market is larger, which means more money will need to be spent                            |
| More potential customers | A larger than niche market, so more people might want to buy the product.      | More competition                              | The market is bigger, and as there is more money to be made there will be more people trying to make money in the market.                |
| Cost efficient           | Economies of scale can be used so unit costs can be reduced.                   | Less attractive to consumers                  | Not focused on their needs specifically, so niche markets will be more likely to capture their interest if they exist for that customer. |

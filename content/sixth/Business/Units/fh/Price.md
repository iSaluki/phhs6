## Benefits and drawbacks to using cost to influence price

### Benefits

- Easy to calculate
- Price increases can be justified when costs rise
- Managers can be confident each product is being sold at profit

### Drawbacks

- Ignores price elasticity of demand
- May not take account of competition
- Profit is lost if price is set below the cost of production

## Price Skimming

- Setting a high price to maximize profit
- Works well for products that create excitement amongst “early adopters”
- Frequently used in the technology industry
- Product is sold to different market segments at different times, allowing for high initial profits
	- Will maximize profit per unit to achieve a quick recovery of development costs

## Price Penetration

- Setting a low introductory price
- Opposite of price skimming
- Aim is to
	- Gain market share quickly
	- Build customer usage and loyalty
	- Build sales of high-priced related items (“hook and bait” approach)
- Price can be increased once a target market share is reached

**Hook & Bait pricing**: Selling a product for a very low price, but it requires another product to work. For example, a printer requires ink—so a company may sell a printer for a low price but then sell ink at a high price to recoup their money through people having to buy new ink.

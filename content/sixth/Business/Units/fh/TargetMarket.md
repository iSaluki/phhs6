A target market is the set of customers sharing common needs and wants that a business decides to target.

## Three Main Strategies for Targeting a Market

**Mass marketing (undifferentiated)**: Business targets the whole market, ignoring segments. Products focus on the common needs and wants of customers, not focusing on edge cases.

**Segmented (differentiated):** Business targets several market segments within the same market. Products are designed and targeted at each segment. Requires separate marketing plans and often different business units and product portfolios.

**Concentrated (niche):** Business focuses narrowly on smaller segments or niches. Aim is to achieve a strong market position (share) within those niches.

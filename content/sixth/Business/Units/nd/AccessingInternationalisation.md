### Multinational Companies

- A multinational company (MNC) is a business that has operations in more than one country. Note that a business does not become an MNC simply because it sells its goods and services overseas. The key to being an MNC is the business has operations in two or more countries.

#### Key reasons for rapid growth of MNCs

- Global brands seeking to drive revenue and profit growth in emerging economies (in particularly seeking rising demand from increasingly affluent consumers)
- The search for economies of scale, to reduce unit costs by concentrating production in a few key international locations
- The perceived need to supplement relatively weak demand in existing, developed economies
- The need to operate in many countries to avoid protectionism
- Increased takeover activity that has built businesses with widespread international operations

#### Potential benefits of MNCs to countries in which they operate

- MNCs provide significant employment and training to the labour force in the host country
- Transfer of skills and expertise, helping to develop the quality of the host labour force
- MNCs add to the host country GDP through their spending, for example with local suppliers and through capital investment
- Competition from MNCs acts as an incentive to domestic firms in the host country to improve their competitiveness, perhaps by raising quality and/or efficiency
- MNCs extend consumer business choice in the host country
- Profitable MNCs are a source of significant tax revenues for the host economies

#### Potential Drawbacks of MNC activity in the countries in which they operate

- Domestic businesses may not be able to compete with MNCs
- MNCs may not feel that they need to meet the host country expectations for acting ethically
- MNCs may be accused of imposing their culture on the host country, perhaps at the expense of local culture
- Profits earned by MNCs may be remitted back to the MNCs base country rather than reinvested in the host economy
- MNCs may make use of transfer pricing and other tax avoidance measures to significantly reduce the profits on which they pay tax to the government in the host country.

1) This year RDFL has seen a decline in financial health. Most notably, their revenue figures have declined since last year, and when inflation is included in considerations this means that the business will have less cash to spend despite higher costs, which is reflected by the cost of sales. Overheads also seem to have increased which will apply additional pressure for good financial results. It is also crucial to note that the business cash reserves have fallen from £40,000 to £0, meaning that there is now a debt risk. Going into debt will continue to harm the financial performance of the business as interest payments will be due on top of debt repayments.

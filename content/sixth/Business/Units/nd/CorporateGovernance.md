### Divorce between ownership and control

- The divorce between ownership and control happens when the owners of a business do not control the day-to-day decisions made in the business
- The majority of shareholders in public companies are not involved in any way with operational decision-making by the companies in which they have invested.

#### Handling issues caused by the divorce between ownership and control

- Ensure that financial rewards and incentives offered to managers are aligned with shareholder interests
- Implement suitable corporate governance procedures to ensure shareholders are protected as far as possible
- Company legislation ensuring that Directors are accountable for their actions to shareholders

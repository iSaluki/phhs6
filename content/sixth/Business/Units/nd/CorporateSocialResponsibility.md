- Business needs society
	- Create demand
	- Public assets and infrastructure
	- Legal protection

- Some argue that that it is not the job of businesses to be concerned about social issues and problems
- Two schools of thought:
	- Free market view: the job of business is to create wealth for shareholders
	- Corporate social responsibility view: business should be concerned with social issues

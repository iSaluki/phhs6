### What is CSR?

- The extent to which a business addresses the concerns and obligations to its wider stakeholders
- The actions a business takes over and above the minimum required by law in addressing societal needs and wants

- CSR is based on the idea that the needs of business and society are interdependent

- Society needs business
	- Employment & wages
	- Investment & innovation
	- Profits & taxes
- Business needs society
	- Create demand
	- Public assets and infrastructure
	- Legal protection


### The Debate on Social Responsibility

- Not all business organisations behave in a socially responsible manner
- Some argue that that it is not the job of businesses to be concerned about social issues and problems
- Two schools of thought:
	- Free market view: the job of business is to create wealth for shareholders
	- Corporate social responsibility view: business should be concerned with social issues

## Initial Questions

1) Capacity utilisation is calculated as
used capacity/total capacity x 100

2) 13,000 capacity
11,500 produced (2020)
14,000 produced (2021)

11,500/13,000 x 100 = 88.46%

14,000/13,000 x 100 = 107.69%

Utilisation change = 19.23%


3) Running at high capacity utilisation means high efficency, so you are maximising profits.

4) Running at high utilisation  does not protect against contingencies. So you are vulnerable to faults.

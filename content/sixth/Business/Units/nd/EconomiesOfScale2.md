Total production cost in period / Total out per period


- Internal Economies of Scale
	- Purchasing economies
	- Technical
	- Managerial
	- Marketing
	- Network
	- Financial

- External Economies of Scale
	- Arise from the industry as a whole
	- Often associated with particular geographic areas

	- Having many specialist suppliers close by
	- Access to research and development facilities
	- Pool of skilled labour to choose from

### Economies of Scope

- Where it is cheaper to produce a range of products rather than specialise in a very limited number

- Eg
	- Hypermarkets
	- Amazon

### Diseconomies of Scale

- Diseconomies lead to a rise in unit costs
- They happen when a  business expands beyond an optimum size and loses productive efficiency
- Diseconomies may be due to:

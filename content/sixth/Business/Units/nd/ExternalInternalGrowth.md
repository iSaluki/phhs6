### Why is growth important?

- Shows progress
	- Managers
	- Shareholders
	- Achievement
- Creates financial benefit
	- Lower costs increased revenues
	- Can't afford to not grow
- Creates positive working environment

### Internal Growth

- Sometimes organic growth
- Occurs when the business expands it's own operations opposed to the business making acquisitions

#### Causes of internal growth

- Increasing existing production capacity through investment in new capital & technology
- Development and launch of new products
- Finding new markets, exporting to other countries or diversification
- Growing a customer base through improved marketing

### External Growth

- Many advantages compared to internal growth
	- Faster speed of access to new product or market areas
	- Increased market share / increased market power
	- Access internal economies of scale
	- Secure better distribution channels or control of of supplies
	- Acquire intangible assets such as brands, patents and trademarks
	- Overcome barriers to entry to target new markets
	- Enter new segments of an existing market
	- To take advantage of deregulation in an industry or market

#### Horizontal Integration

- Two companies in the same market merge, direct competitors.

- Advantages of horizontal integration:
	- Increases size of business and enables economies of scale
	- Synergies
	- A wider range of products
	- Reduces competition

#### Vertical Integration

- Two companies in the same industry but different points on the supply chain
- **Forward Vertical:** Closer to the final consumers of the product (a manufacturer buying a retailer)
- **Backward Vertical:** Closer to the raw materials in the supply chain (eg, a retailer buying a manufacturer)

- Advantages of vertical integration
	- Control of the supply chain
	- Improved access to key raw materials (possibly at the expense of rivals)
	- Better control over distribution channels
	- Removing supplier and crucial competitor information

### Franchises in Internal Growth

- Spread costs: franchisees cover some of the costs and shield the franchiser from some of the risk
- Growth can be far quicker as franchisees can be given responsibility 
- Franchisee can handle the day to day growth and operation whilst the franchiser can build a strong brand for the business, creating a sort of symbiotic relationship between the two.
- Franchises typically lead to far quicker internal growth, however may dilute the control of the franchiser if their contract is not watertight.


### Joint Ventures

- A joint venture is a separate business entity created by two or more parties involving shared ownership, returns and risks
- Usually in a 50:50 share but this does not have to be the case
- Parties entering into a joint venture usually do so to benefit from complementary strengths or shared resources whilst also mitigating risks.

#### Advantages

-  Shared benefit from each others expertise and resources
- Each partner might have the option to acquire the JV business
- Reduce the risk of a growth strategy

#### Disadvantages

- Risk of clashing organisational structures
- The objectives of each partner may change leading to a conflict of objectives
- In practice there may be an imbalance in levels of expertise, investment or assets brought into the venture by different partners
- Failure could lead to disagreement over ownership of assets

#### Examples

- BMW and Brilliance Auto Group
- Microsoft and General Electric
- Walmart and Eko
- Verily and GlaxoSmithKline
- Boeing and Lockheed Martin

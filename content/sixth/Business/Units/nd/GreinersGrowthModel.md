| Phase         | Crisis     | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Creativity    |            | Staff levels are low growth comes from owners working longer hours. Informal communication works.                                                                                                                   |
| Direction     | Leadership | Informal communication starts to fail so firm sets up specialised departments and formalises communication. Founder still makes strategic decisions. Business now too big for leader to get involved in everything. |
| Delegation    | Autonomy   | Business now has functional management through middle management. But founder still struggling to let go.                                                                                                           |
| Coordination  | Control    | More formal management structures in place usually performance related pay structures introduced. But new layers of hierarchy needed to keep control.                                                               |
| Collaboration | Red Tape   | A dangerous growth in organisational bureaucracy, slowing decision-making and missing external changes usually solved by a matrix structure.                                                                        |
| Alliances     | Growth     | Growth slowing as business runs out of ideas. Alliances are sought (including new business owners)                                                                                                                  |

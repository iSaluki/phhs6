### Horizontal

- Buying a company in the same industry and stage of the supply change

- Economies of scale
- Diversification
- Synergy benefit

### Vertical

- Buying a company in the same industry but at a different stage


**Forward and vertical** - Acquiring a business further up in the supply chain
**Backward and vertical** - Acquiring a business operating earlier in the supply chain
**Horizontal** - Acquiring a business at the same stage of the supply chain
**Conglomerate** - Where the acquisition has no clear connection to the business buying it


### Potential benefits of Horizontal Integration

- Achieve economies of scale
- Cost synergies (savings) from the rationalisation of the business
- Potential to secure revenue synergies
- Wider range of products (diversification)
- Reduces competition by removing key rivals - this increases market share and long-run pricing power
- Buying an existing and well-known brand can be cheaper than organically growing a brand - this can then make the entry barriers higher for potential rivals

### Potential benefits of Vertical Integration

- Enables a business to capture a greater share of the profit on each sale
- Secures important sources of supply or distribution
- Creates a barrier to entry to potential new competitors
- Gain greater insights into customer needs and wants at each stage of the supply chain

**The process of analysing whether investment projects are worthwhile.**

### Annual Average Rate of Return (ARR)

- The annual percentage return on an investment project based on average returns earned by the project

#### Calculating and interpreting ARR

- Calculate the **average** annual **profit** from the investment project
- Divide the average annual profit by the initial investment outlay
- Compare with the target percentage return

#### ARR worksheets

£80,000 capital cost
£26,000 per year for 5 years
(26000x5 = 130,000)
130,000 - 80,000 = £50,000 profit
50,000/5 = 10,000

10,000 / 80,000 x 100 = 12.5% ARR

£130,000 capital investment

Returns:
Year 1 → £35,000
Year 2 → £40,000
Year 3 → £50,000
Year 4 → £60,000

(35000+40000+50000+60000 = 185,000)

Average annual return: 
£185,000 - 130,000 = £55,000
55,000 / 4 = **£13,750**

13,750/ 130,000 x 100 = **10.57% ARR**

£50,000 capital cost

Year 1 -> £30,000



---

£130,000 capital cost

Return per year:
Year 1 -> £28,000
Year 2 -> £33,000
Year 3 -> £37,000
Year 4 -> £41,000
Year 5 -> £48,000

(28000+33000+37000+41000+48000) = £18700
187,0000- 130,000 = £174000
174000/5 = £34,800
34800/130,000 x 100 =  26.7% ARR (8.77% correct ans)


Opt 2:

£180,000 + 20,000 = £200,000 capital cost

### Discounted Cash Flow (NPV)

**Net present value (NPV) calculates the monetary value now of a project's future cash flows.**

- Discounting is the method used to reduce the future value of cash flows to reflect the risk of inflation or the investment not working out.

#### The Time Value of Money

- Better to receive cash now than in the future
- Future cash flows are worth less
- Use discount factors to bring cash flows back to their present value
- Relevant discount factor determined by required rate of return

#### Calculating the present value of a future cashflow

> [!note] Formula
>
> Cash Flow x Discount Factor = Present Value 

If NPV is positive, then the investment is worth doing.
If NPV is negative, then the investment is not worth doing.

If you have a choice between two positive NPV projects, then you want the one with the highest NPV.

### Payback Period

- Identify the net cash flows for each period (eg, a year)
- Keep a running total of the cash flows
	- Initial investment is an outflow
	- When does the running total move from negative to positive (outflows)
	- When the total net cash flow becomes positive, that is the end of the payback period.


| Year | Cash Flow Detail      | Cash flow £ | Cumulative Cash Flow | Payback? |
|------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| 0    | Investment (cash out) | (500,000)   | (500,000)            | No       |
| 1    | Net Cash Inflows      | 100,000     | (400,000)            | No       |
| 2    | Net Cash Inflows      | 150,000     | (250,000)            | No       |
| 3    | Net Cash Inflows      | 175,000     | (75,000)             | No       |
| 4    | Net Cash Inflows      | 150,000     | 75,000               | Yes      |

In this case, there is an overshoot. It took 3 and a bit years to reach payback. We can tell because there is more than 0 at the end of year 4. 

#### Benefits of payback period

- Simple and easy to calculate
- Focus on cashflows
- Easy to understand the results
- Emphasises speed of return; good for fast moving markets
- Straightforward to compare competing products 

#### Drawbacks of payback period

- Ignores cash flows after payback has been reached
- Takes no account of the "time value of money"
- May encourage short-term thinking
- Ignores qualitative aspects
- Does not actually create a decision for the investment.

**Leaders**: Inspire people, build relationships, take risks and have followers.

**Managers**: Enact the plan, use their authority, manage risks, have subordinates

Both are closely linked and one person may have to do both roles.

> Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things - **Peter Drucker**

## Traditional Levels of Management

The "*Blake Mouton Managerial Grid*" shows how management styles differ between the balance between a concern for people and concern for results.

Produce or Perish Management is also called Task Management.

### Impoverished Management

Laissez-faire style; minimal effort on management; looking to avoid blame for errors. 

Low concern for people and task

### Country Club Management
Focus on creating safe, comfortable working environment with minimal conflict.

High concern for people, low concern for task

### Task Management
Autocratic style, consistent with McGregor Theory X. Workers have to complete tasks - nothing else.

Low concern for people, high concern for task.

### Team Management
Staff closely involved in decision-making and feel valued; consistent with McGregor Theory Y.

High concern for both people and task.

### Middle of the Road Management
Compromises made to achieve acceptable performance; thought to be the less effective leadership style.

Medium concern for people and task.

- Sometimes known as **Critical Path Analysis**
- CPA is a project analysis and planning method that allows a project to be completed in the shortest possible time

### Information needed for CPA

- A list of all **activities** required to complete the project
- The time (**duration**) that each activity will take to completion
- The **dependencies** between the activities (eg, activity D cannot be completed until both activities B and C are done.)

### What is the Critical Path?

- The sequence of a project activities which add up to the **longest overall duration**. The critical path determines the shortest time possible to complete the project.
### Why is the Critical Path so important?

- Any delay of an activity on the critical path directly impacts the planned project completion date (ie, there is no float on the critical path)

Overtrading happens when a business expands too quickly without having the financial resources to support such a quick expansion.

- If suitable sources of finance are not obtained, overtrading can lead to business failure.
- Importantly, overtrading can occur even when a business is profitable. It is an issue of working capital and cash flow.
- Overtrading is, therefore, essentially a problem of growth.
- It is particularly associated with retail businesses who attempt to grow too fast.

**Sensitivity analysis is a technique which allows the analysis of changes in assumptions used in forecasts.**

### Assumptions

**Cash flow forecast:** Timing and amounts
**Budgeted profit:** Sales volumes and unit selling prices
**Investment appraisal:** Timing and amount of project cash flows over a period
Etcetera

- What if assumptions are worse by 10%?

### Benefits and Drawbacks

#### Benefits

- Identifies the most significant assumptions
- Helps assess risk and prepare for a less favourable scenario
- Helps make the process of business forecasting more robust

#### Drawbacks

- Only tests one assumption at a time (many assumptions may be linked)
- Only as good as the data on which forecasts are based
- A somewhat complicated concept - not understood by all managers

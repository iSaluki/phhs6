A **stakeholder** is anybody with an interest in the business.

**Starbucks Stakeholders:**
- Employees
- Shareholders
- Customers
- Government
- Suppliers
- Local community
- Competitors
- Pressure groups
- Charities


Stakeholders can be categorized as either *internal* or *external*. An internal stakeholder is part of the business, whereas an external stakeholder is not.

Internal:
- Employees
- Shareholders

External:
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Local Community
- Competition
- Charities
- Pressure groups

Stakeholder needs should be considered when making decisions. This can help to avoid resistance to change.

- Businesses use stakeholder mapping to help inform decision-making
	- Stakeholder mapping the relative power of each stakeholder group against the degree of interest
	- This helps inform managers pm how important each stakeholder group is and therefore how involved they should be in the decision-making process.

## Decision-making

### Hunch
- Based on intuition, gut feel and experience
- Key benefit - very quick!
- But hard to justify for business decisions involving significant risk.

### Scientific
- Based on data and analysis
- Downside: time-consuming and costly; no guarantee of the right decision.
- Increasingly common and automated, supported by Big Data and data analytics

### Inventory Types

**Stock**: Finished products
**Raw materials:** Components required to make stock
**Work In Progress:** Stock that has not been finished

### Challenges of inventory management

- Costly to store
- Needs securing
- Climate controlled environment (dependent on inventory contents)
- Retrieval and deposit

Leading to:

- Negative impact on profit when storing lots
- Cash flow problem (cash will leave, but money won't come in on stored stock)

> [!danger] Holding too much stock is bad
>
> Leads to various issues with cash flow and can lead to perishable goods expiring

### Positives to having inventory

- Avoids production interruptions and inefficiencies 
- Resilience—protection from supply chain disruptions
- Quality-having a product available maintains customer relations and perception of quality

## Worksheet

### Business A
1) Minimum stock level: 20
2) Reorder level: 30
3) Weekly Sales: 10 
4) Lead time: 2 weeks
5) Holding buffer stock gives them the ability to handle any increased demands or supply chain disruptions without impacting their customers. This will lead to an overall higher quality service provided by the business, and likely a better reputation.
### Business B
1) Minimum stock level: 400
2) Reorder Quantity: 1100 units
3) About 75 units per week
4) Lead time: About 3 weeks
5) If demand declines or the stock is perishable they will face the risk of wasting stock, which will result in a negative impact on revenue and cash flow. It is important that the business does everything it can to avoid this.
### Business C
1) Daily sales until day 220: about 100/day
2) Lead time: 30 days
3) An unexpected increase in demand has caused them to enter their buffer stock and hit a stock level of 0 before the resupply order could arrive. 
4) To prevent this, they could have tried to predict this increase in demand and order more units in the previous order. They could also have seen units were selling faster than usual, and ordered new units early or simply maintained a higher buffer stock level to give them more time to deal with high demand.

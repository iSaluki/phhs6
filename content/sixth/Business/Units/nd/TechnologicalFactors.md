- This could include things from computational power to engine efficiency.

### Impact on business

- The cost of keeping up to date with the latest technology

### Practice exercise 3 (NF)

#### Identify and explain one example of the impact of technological change on each functional area within a business

- The warehouse team at a distribution company would benefit from more capable technology. If all the items in the warehouse are tracked digitally, then a phone-type device could be used by workers to navigate to and quickly locate any item. 
- This would lead to a temporary decrease in productivity whilst workers get used to the new system
- There would be higher costs as the handhelds would need purchasing and powering, and the system would have license fees
- However, in the long-term there will be increased productivity across the organisation as more orders can be fulfilled more efficiently. 


#### Identify and explain one example of the impact of technological change on business strategy.

- Artifical Intelligence (AI) will be able to provide lots of previously human only labour at much lower costs, much faster and likely at a more reliable quality.
- If a business adopts AI as a replacement for a human role, they will likely be able to outcompete other businesses in the area, **assuming that AI is capable enough to perform the role properly**. This will put pressure on competitors to make the same change.
- This may also demoralise employees as they may feel their job security has been weakened.
- The business will likely have to plan for making a smooth transition towards AI technologies at the correct time for each area of the business.


#### Explain two benefits to consumers of the use of new technology.

- Less waiting time. New technology typically increases productivity, as people have to do less manual work due to automation. This improves customer experience because their interactions with the business will be faster and have less friction.

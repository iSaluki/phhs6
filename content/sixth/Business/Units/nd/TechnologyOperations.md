## Benefits of technology

- Testing can be performed without wasting a physical product. thanks to simulations.
- Efficiency can be improved.
- Faster iteration.
- Improvements can be suggested automatically.
- Inefficiencies can be ironed out quickly.
- Manufacturing can be sped up.
- Manufacturing can continue 24/7.

## Drawbacks

- Technology can require high upfront investment.
- Requires skill to use.
- Requires maintaining by someone with equipment and training.
- Dependent on electricity and internet connectivity.
- Can be too rigid for certain systems—meaning that if a business adds a new product with lots of customisations, it may not be reflected properly on their till.
- Technology moves quickly, may only last several years before replacements are needed.

- Big data refers to large datasets that have grown to such an enormous size that have grown to such enormous size that traditional data processing tools can no longer store, manipulate or analyse it.
- This type of data cannot be handled by traditional databases and hence it is difficult to structure them and convert it to meaningful analysis.
- In several applications, data is updated in real-time and the speed at which data changes is also a challenge to computer scientists.

- Volume
	- Lots of data
- Variety
	- Lots of differences
- Velocity
	- Arriving very quickly

### Example: Weather

- Consider a website that shows the weather information of major cities around the world
- The information is updated hourly and the website also predicts future weather. This is a huge amount of information to handle.
- The data received initially will be unstructured. For example, satellite images are used to calculate cloud cover.
- An algorithm is used to find the percentage of cloud cover and the possibility of rain.

### Examples of Big Data

- Medical research
- Financial services and banking sector
- E-commerce website
- Government

### Structured vs Unstructured Data

- Structured
	- Information that is stored in a predefined manner, that is, in a structure is called structured data.
	- A database helps us to store data in a structured manner.
- Unstructured
	- Information that is not structured in a predefined manner is called unstructured data.
	- Data in a word or notepad are examples of unstructured data

- Big data refers to large datasets that have grown to such an enormous size that have grown to such enormous size that traditional data processing tools can no longer store, manipulate or analyse it.
- This type of data cannot be handled by traditional databases and hence it is difficult to structure them and convert it to meaningful analysis.
- In several applications, data is updated in real-time and the speed at which data changes is also a challenge to computer scientists.

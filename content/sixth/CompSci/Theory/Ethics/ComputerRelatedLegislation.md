### Recall

- A computer will one day be more intelligent than a human being
	- The rate of acceleration in computing technology is high, and computers are already capable of achieving things that are, by some, considered human or more than human.
	- AI and related technologies are advancing exponentially, and technology typically develops in a sigmoid curve. This suggests AI has not reached its peak yet and will continue to advance. Therefore, it is feasible that AI will exceed human intelligence before it peaks.

### Legal issues

- Computer technology is used in various applications, and computers have become an essential part of our daily lives
- This dependence on computer technology has also created many problems such as cybercrimes, data theft, etc
- Legal issues include: data theft, corruption of data, identity theft, use of pirated software, fraud and harrassment.
- These are punishable by law

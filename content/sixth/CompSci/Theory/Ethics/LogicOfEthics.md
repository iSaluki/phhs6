### Advantages/Disadvantages of self-driving cars

#### Adv

- Reduces human error
- Sensors are more reliable than human senses
- No learners
- Doesn't get tired
- Roads could be narrower
- No road signs needed
- Can safely travel much faster
- No windshield needed, could be designed for efficiency rather than including things like mirrors.
- Less congestion
- More efficient routing
- Can't break road laws
- Can all be fully electric
#### Disadv

- Ethical issues â€“ can AI pick life or death
- Who is at fault in the event of an accident
- Disaster responses or unknown events might be handled poorly compared to a human driver
- Will take away human jobs (drivers)
- Reduces human freedoms
- Fail safe systems must be very good

### Ethical Bias

- People have biases towards and against certain characteristics
- These biases could easily be passed onto machines
- How should machines make tough ethical decisions

#### Algorithmic Bias
- If a system is taught to always assume a cyclist wears a helmet, how should it manage a cyclist without a helmet? It wouldn't recognise the helmetless cyclist.

Do these biases matter? How much?

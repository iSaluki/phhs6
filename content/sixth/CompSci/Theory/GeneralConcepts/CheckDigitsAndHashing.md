### Hashing Algorithm

- A hash in computer science is an algorithm that performs a complex calculation on some source data.
- The intention is to produce a much smaller value.
- **The final value can only be produced from a limited number of inputs.**


### Pigeon Hole Principle

- Because the hash is smaller than the original data it should be clear that there are more possible sources than there are possible hashes.
- This idea is known as the pigeonhole principle.

### Check Digit

- A check digit is produced by a hashing algorithm
- It is used to confirm that the data being processed has been received correctly
- Used extensively in data capture devices such as barcode scanners.

### What is it?

- A paradigm is simply the way you look at and make sense of the world

- So a programming paradigm is a way of thinking about and expressing a computer program.

- There are quite a few paradigms and some are related
	- Imperative: structured, procedural and object-oriented are examples
		- As a general rule, imperative languages explain how to do something step by step
	- Declarative: functional database (SQL) and mark-up languages (HTML)
		- As a rule, declarative languages describe the problem and the system knows how to deal with it

### Structured Programming

- Code that is imperative
	- That is, it defines a series of steps that must be performed to complete a task

- Structured programming is a subset of imperative programming.

- Structured programming sees the world as a sequence of tasks that can be broken down into small, easy to manage chunks 
	- These chunks can be reused

- A vector is a “point in space” reference to another “point in space”
- They can be one, two or three dimensional
- They have [both direction and magnitude](https://youtu.be/A05n32Bl0aY?t=28)

- One-dimensional 
	- Single direction
		- Index of an array
		- Position in a file (distance from start)
		- Record in a table
		- Distance along a line

- Two-dimensional
	- Two directions in a flat plane
		- Direction and distance along a plane.
		- Direction and force along a plane.
	- Measured as X and Y
		- X is horizontal
		- Y is vertical
	- Word vectors
		- “Male”, “Royal” → “King”

- Three-dimensional
	- Three directions in a space
		- Direction and distance
		- Direction and force
	- Measured as X, Y and Z
		- X is horizontal forwards/backwards
		- Y is horizontal left/right
		- Z is vertical up/down

## What is the problem?

- Currently, most schools use search engines such as Google or Bing.
- These engines are functional and deliver the expected results, but there are some key downsides to using these:
    - Privacy
        - Google and Microsoft have poor privacy practices and track records. And their terms of service do nothing to help reassure us about this. ([Google](https://tosdr.org/en/service/217), [Microsoft](https://tosdr.org/en/service/331))
    - No impact
        - Neither Google or Bing make any major efforts to have a positive impact on society. They make [large profits](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266206/googles-annual-global-revenue/) which are then retained within the companies.

## Is there a solution?

- Yes, there are other search engines that can deliver equivalent result qualities, whilst using their earnings to make a meaningful impact on society.

### [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/)
- Ecosia is a search engine dedicated to planting trees around the world. For every 45 searches made across their platform, they fund the planting of 1 tree.
- They have recently surpassed 200M trees planted, and have made their pledge legally binding.
- In terms of [terms](https://tosdr.org/en/service/591), they're performing better than Google and Microsoft.
- Ecosia also runs their servers on renewable energy, ensuring that they minimise any climate impact to the maximum.
- They are comitted to donating 100% of profit to climate projects, meaning they go above and beyond their tree planting pledge with [other projects](https://blog.ecosia.org/climate-projects/)
- They have extreme financial transparency - [just take a look](https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/)

In 2021, Ecosia was actively planting trees in the following countries

- Ecosia is easy to switch to, and provides guides for organisations looking to switch [here](https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/557-technical-guides-for-it)
- They also enable organisations to track their [impact easily](https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/564-switch-your-large-company-to-ecosia#Measure-your-performance-Ejsy6) if they would like to track their overall impact.

#### Who's using Ecosia?

- Some notable organisations that are using Ecosia include:

### [OceanHero](https://oceanhero.today/)

- Whilst Ecosia is the big player, they're not the only option.
- Instead of planting a tree every 45 searches, OceanHero removes around 1 plastic bottle worth of plastic from the ocean with every 5 searches.
- [How does OceanHero work?](https://oceanhero.today/about-us/how-it-works)
- They are also involved in education about plastic and the construction of recycling plants.



### How easy is it to use?

- Both Ecosia and OceanHero are very easy to configure as default search engines.
- For individuals, it can be changed in your browser of choice [without any real effort](https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/502-ecosia-on-desktop). 
- For organisations, [this guide](https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/557-technical-guides-for-it) makes it easy for most setups.

### What are the risks?

- For OceanHero, less is known and I cannot personally provide much insight. 
- However, for Ecosia there are effectively no risks.
	- Results
		- Ecosia uses results sourced from Microsoft and Google, meaning quality should be equal to those provided by the standard search engines.
	- Performance
		- These days, Ecosia is massive and can easily handle all searches, there are rarely any technical issues and it is unlikely that any major problems will occur.
	- Privacy
		- Whilst search engines can access a lot of personal information, Ecosia is generally considered more trustworthy than Microsoft or Google, and their Terms of Service provide more robust protections to users.

Their tails are made from fatty acids, but not always the same. A straight tail is made of saturated fatty acids and a tail with a kink in it (caused by a C=C double bond) is an unsaturated fatty acid.\n\nThe purpose of  a kinked tail is increased membrane stability. It separates phospholipids out and prevents them from becoming too tightly packed.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221019120603.png]]\n\nCholesterol fits in with the phospholipids and helps to regulate the fluidity of the membrane. It does this by increasing fluidity at low temperatures by keeping the phospholipids apart and preventing a cease in motion. At higher temperatures, they have the opposite effect and reduce the fluidity of the membrane by holding the phospholipids in place and stopping them from moving too much.\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.588377813Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/CellTheory":{"title":"Cell Theory","content":"\nCell theory is the basic foundation on which our understanding of cells is built.\n\n## The discovery of cell theory over time\n\n**Robert Hooke** - 1665\n\n- cork cells\n- \"tiny boxes\"\n\n**Anton van Leeuwenhoek** - 1673\n\n- \"Animacules\", later called bacteria\n\n**Robert Brown** - 1833\n\n- Discovered the [nucleus](Organelles.md#nucleus) in plant cells\n\n**Matthias Schleiden** - 1838\n\n- Every plant is made of cells\n\n**Theodor Schwann** - 1839\n\n- Every animal is made of cells\n\n**Albrecht von Roelliker** - 1840\n\n- Sperm + Egg are cells - life comes from cells.\n\n**Carl Heinrich Braun** - 1845\n\n- Reworks theory, names cells \"the basic unit of life\"\n\n**Rudolf Virchow** - 1855\n\n- Cells come from other cells\n\n\n## Modern cell theory\n\n- The cell contains hereditary information (DNA) which is passed on from cell to cell during division.\n- All cells are basically the same in terms of chemical composition and metabolic activities.\n- All basic chemical and physiological functions are carried out inside cells.

The distinguishing factor between rough and smooth ER is that rough ER is coated with ribosomes.\n\nrER is the cells internal transport system and creates channels that enable the transport of substances from one section of the cell to another. The rER provides a large surface area for ribosomes to attach. The ribosomes assemble proteins from amino acids , these proteins are then absorbed through the membrane and are transported by the rER to the Golgi Apparatus for modification and packaging. \n\n## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (sER/Smooth ER)\nLike the rER, this is a system of membrances within the cell that contain fluid-filled cavities that link to the nuclear envelope. It DOES NOT have ribosomes on its surface.\n\nsER contains enzymes that catalyse reactions involved with the metabolism of lipids. This includes: \n\n- synthesis of cholesterol\n- synthesis of lipids/phospholids needed by the cell\n- synthesis of steroid hormones\n\nIt is involved with the absorption, synthesis and transport of lipids from the gut.\n\n## Golgi Apparatus\nThis consist of a stack of membrane bound flattened sacs. Secretory vesicles bring materials to  and from the Golgi. \n\nProteins are modified here. Examples include:\n\n- adding sugar molecules to make glycoproteins\n- adding lipid molecules to make lipoproteins\n- folding proteins into their 3D shape\n\nThese proteins are then packaged into vesicles that are pinched off and then:\n\n- stored in the cell\n- moved to the plasma membrane, either to be incorporated into the plasma membrane or to be exported out of the cell.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nThese are usually spherical, rod-shaped or branched structures and are typically 2-5μm long. They are enclosed in two membranes with a fluid-filled space between them. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae. The inner-most section of the mitochondria is a fluid-filled matrix.\n\nMitochondria are the site of ATP production during aerobic respiration. They are also self-replicating, so more can be made to meet energy denand if the cell requires it. They are abundant in cells where any form of metabolic activity takes place. This includes cells in your liver and synapses.\n\n## Vacuole\nThe vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast and contains fluid. \n\nOnly plant cells have a large permanent vacuole. They are filled with water and various solutes to maintain the stability of the cell - as when they are full they exert force on the cell wall, causes the cell to become turgid. If all the plant cells are turgid, this helps to support non-woody plants.\n\n## Lysosomes\nThese are small bags formed from the Golgi apparatus. Each is enclosed within a single membrane. They contain powerful hydrolytic (digestive) enzymes. They are abundant in immune cells such as phagocytes, neutrophils and macrophages that can ingest and digest invading bacteria. \n\nLysosomes keep the dangerous enzymes seperate from the rest of the cell, preventing damage to organelles. Lysosomes can engulf dead cell organelles and foreign matter and return digested components for reuse. \n\n## Cilia and undulipodia\nThese are protrusions from the cell and are surrounded by the cell surface membrane. Each contains microtubules (see Cytoskeleton for more details). They are formed from centrioles.\n\nThe epitheal cells lining your airways have many hundreds of cilia that beat and move the band of mucus. Nearly all cell types in the body have one cilium that acts as an antenna. It contains receptors and allows cells to detect signals about their immediate environment. The only human cell to have an undulipodium (a lot of cillium) is a spermatozoon. The unulipodium allows the spermatozoon to move.\n\n## Ribosomes\nSmall, spherical and about 20nm in diameter they are constructed from ribosomal RNA. They are made in the nucleolus from two different subunits which pass through the nucelar envelope into the cell cytoplasm and then combine. Some remain free in the cytoplasm and some attach to the rER.\n\nRibosomes bound to the exterior of the rER are mainly for synthesising proteins that will be exported out of the cell. Ribosomes that are free in the cytoplasm - either singularly or in a cluster - are primarily a site for synthesising proteins that will be used in the cell. \n\n## Centrioles\nThe centrioles consist of two bundles of microtubles at right angles to each other. The microtubules are made of tublin protein subunits, and are arranged to form a cylinder.\n\nBefore a cell divides, the spindle, made of threads of tubulin, forms from the centrioles. Chromosomes attach to the middle part of the spindle and motor proteins walk along the tubin threads, pulling the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. Centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and undulipodia:\n\n- Before the cilia form, the centrioles multiply and line up beneath the cell surface membrane.\n- Microtubules then sprout outwards from each centriole, forming a cilium or undulipodium.\n\nCentrioles are usually absent from unicellular green algae.\n\n## Cytoskeleton\nA network of protein structures within the cytoplasm. It consists of:\n\n- rod-like microfilaments made of subunits of the protein actin; they are polymers of actin and each microfilament is about 7nm in diameter.\n- intermmediate filaments about 10nm in diameter.\n- straight, cylindrical microtubules, made of protein subunits called tubulin, about 18-30nm in diameter. \n- The **cytoskeletal motor proteins**, myosins, kinesins and dyeins, are molecular motors. They are also enzymes and have a site that binds to and allows hydrolysis of ATP as their energy source.\n\nThe protein microfilaments within the cytoplasm give support and mechanical strength, keep the cell's shape stable and allow cell movement. They also:\n\n- form the spindle before cell division\n- form a track for motor proteins to walk along\n- make up the cilia, undulipodia and centrioles\n\nAnd intermediate filaments:\n\n- anchor the nucleus to the cytoplasm\n- extend between cells in certain tissues, enabling cell-cell signalling.\n\n## Cellulose cell wall\nThe cell wall of plants is outside the plasma membrane and is constructed from a bundle of cellulose fibres.\n\nThe cell wall is strong and and can prevent plant cells from bursting when turgid. The cell wall:\n\n- provides strength\n- maintain cell shape\n- contribute to strength and support of the whole plant\n- are permeable and allow solutions to pass through\n\nFungi have cell walls that contain chitin, not cellulose.\n\n## Chloroplasts\nThese are large organelles, 4-10µm long. They are only present in plants and some protoctists. They are surrounded by a double membrane or envelope. The inner membrane is continuous with flattened membrane sacs called thylakoids. The fluid-filled matrix is called the stroma.\n\nChloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis\nThe first stage of photosynthesis is when light energy is trapped by chlorophyll and used to make ATP. This occurs in the grana. Water is also split to provide hydrogen ions.\nThe second stage when hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide, using energy from ATP to make carbohydrates, occurs in the stroma. \n\nChloroplasts are abundant in leaf cells, particularly the pallisade mesophyll layer.\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.588377813Z","tags":["biology","cells"]},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/OrganellesWorkTogether":{"title":"How organelles work together","content":"**Exocytosis** is the process of exporting materials from the cell.\n\nAn example process of how organelles in a cell would work together to produce insulin would be:\n\n1) Genes are in DNA\n2) They are transcribed to mRNA\n3) The mRNA leaves the nuclear envelope via nuclear pores\n4) Ribosomes are made in the nucleolus\n5) Ribosomes translate the mRNA into a protein, which passes through the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n6) Vesicles containing insulin pass via the Golgi Body\n7) In the Gologi, the insulin is packaged and modified to be ready for use in the body\n8) Vesicles pinched off from Golgi pass to plasma membrane.\n9) Vesicles and the plasma membrane fuse and excrete insulin into the cell's surroundings via exocytosis.\n![[Pasted image 20221019104936.png]]\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.588377813Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/PlantCells":{"title":"Plant Cells","content":"\nSee Chloroplasts, Vacuole and Cell Wall from [Organelles](Organelles.md)\n\nCells are typically viewed under [Light Microscopes](UsingALightMicroscope.md)\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.588377813Z","tags":["biology","cells"]},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/ProkaryoticCells":{"title":"Prokaryotic Cells","content":"![[Pasted image 20221019105229.png]]\n\n\n| **Feature**               | **Prokaryotic**        | **Eukaryotic**                                                     |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nucleus               | Not present        | Present                                                        |\n| DNA                   | Circular           | Nucleus (linear)                                               |\n| DNA Organisation      | Proteins fold      | Chromosomes                                                    |\n| Extra chroma DNA      | Plasmid            | Only present in certain organelles (chloroplast, mitochondria) |\n| Organelles            | Non-membrane bound | Membrane Bound                                                 |\n| Cell Wall             | Present            | Present in some cases                                          |\n| Ribosomes             | Smaller            | Larger                                                         |\n| Cytoskeleton          | Present            | Present                                                        |\n| Reproduction          | Binary Fission     | (a)sexual                                                      |\n| Cell Type             | Unicellular        | Multi-cellular                                                 |\n| Cell Surface-Membrane | Present            | Present                                                        |\n\n\n## Endosymbiosis\n\nEndosymbiosis is the theory that a larger cell engulfed bacteria with energy producing capabilities—eventually becoming chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\nEvidence includes mitochondria and chloroplasts dividing like bacteria; have individual DNA; dividing independently of the cell\n\n## Gram Staining\nMicroscopy stain to help identify different bacteria.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221019110126.png]]\n\n### Gram Positive Bacteria\n- Colour: blue\n- More peptidoglycan\n\n### Gram Negative Bacteria\n- Colour: red\n- Less peptidoglycan\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.588377813Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/SpecialisedAnimalTissues":{"title":"Specialised Animal Tissues","content":"\n## Squamous Epithelium\n\nMade up of specialized squamous epithelial cells, it has a squashed appearance.

The foramen ovale allows blood to travel around the body in a more natural way despite the lungs being non-functional.\n\n## Difference and reason for difference between adult and fetal haemoglobin\n\n- Affinity for oxygen is higher in fetal haemoglobin\n- Allows for fetus to obtain blood from the mother's placenta during pregnancy\n\n## Why does tissue fluid not contain erythrocytes but neutrophils?\n\n- Erythrocytes are too large to pass through openings in the capillary walls, meaning that they remain within the circulatory system and cannot enter the tissue fluid.\n- Neutrophils can enter the tissue fluid due to their multi-lobed nucleus, which allows them to squeeze through small gaps that cells with a more rigid structure like erythrocytes could not.\n\n## Erythrocytes are full of haemoglobin. Describe the role of haemoglobin in transporting oxygen around the body.\n\nHaemoglobin is responsible for binding to oxygen and disassociating from it at appropriate points around the body. Adult haemoglobin will pick oxygen up in an area where the ppO2 (partial pressure of oxygen)is HIGH. And will disassociate from it in areas where the partial pressure is LOW.\n\n## Describe how hydrogen carbonate ions are produced in erythrocytes\n\n- The Chloride Shift\n\n- Chloride ions move **into** red blood cells when hydrogen carbonate ions form. \n- Carbon dioxide diffuses into erythrocytes\n- Carbonic anhydrase catalyses the combination reaction between CO2 and water to form carbonic acid.\n- Carbonic acid disassociates to form hydrogen carbonate ions and hydrogen ions. \n- Hydrogen carbonate ions are transported out of the cell.\n- The chloride ions with a negative charge enter the erythrocyte. \n\n## High concentrations of carbon dioxide in the blood reduce the amount of oxygen transported by haemoglobin. Name and explain this effect.\n\n- Bohr Effect\n\n- Carbon dioxide levels increasing causes more positvely charged hydrogen ions to be produced, which decreases the PH level of the blood. In lower PH, the haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen is reduced, meaning less oxygen can be transported.\n\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.620379245Z","tags":["biology","revision","homework"]},"/sixth/Biology/Circulatory/NeedForTransportSystems":{"title":"The need for transport systems","content":"\n## Substances that require transport\n- Nutrients\n\t- glucose—provide energy\n\t- protein—growth and repair\n\t- amino acids, fatty acids, glycerol\n- Water\n- Carbon Dioxide—removal post respiration\n- Lactic acid—removal of waste\n- Urea—removal of waste\n- Hormones—chemical messaging\n- Enzymes\n\n## Open circulatory system\n- Haemolymph instead of blood\n- No veins, arteries or vessels, the haemolymph moves freely around the body\n- Haemocoel—a central cavity that handles digestive and circulatory functions\n- Organisms with an open circulatory system may still have a heart, or some form of pumping mechanism\n- Low pressure\n- Eg\n\t- ant\n\t- grasshopper\n\t- stick insect\n\n## Closed circulatory system\n- Structured with veins, arteries and capillaries.\n- High pressure\n- Eg\n\t- human\n\t- frog\n\t- bird\n\n## Single circulatory system\n- Blood passes the heart ONCE per cycle.\n- Flow rate/pressure falls when blood leaves the gills or lungs.\n- Low pressure blood inefficient for kidney function.\n\n## Double circulatory system\n- Blood passes the heart TWICE per cycle.\n- Higher pressure.\n- Kidney function is optimal.\n\n### Keywords\n\n- Systemic Circulation\n\t- heart to body\n- Pulmonary Circulation\n\t- heart to lungs\n\n\nSee [Structure of Heart](StructureOfTheHeart.md) for more details on transport\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.620379245Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Circulatory/StructureOfTheHeart":{"title":"Structure of the Heart","content":"\n## Diagram of Heart Structure\n\n![[Pasted image 20221111111303.png]]\n\n## Cardiac Cycle\n*AV = Atrioventricular*\n*SL = Semi-Lunar*\n\n- This is the sequence of events in one heart beat\n\n- filling phase (diastole)\n\t- atria and ventricles are relaxed\n\t- blood enters heart via pulmonary vein and vena cava\n\t- blood flows passively from atria to ventricles (AV valves open)\n\t- SL valves are closed from previous contraction\n- atrial contraction (systole)\n\t- atria contract simultaneously\n\t- forces remaining blood from atria into ventricles\n\t- AV valves close\n- ventricular contraction (systole)\n\t- AV and SL valves are closed\n\t- ventricles contract from the apex (base) upwards\n\t- blood forced out of aorta and pulmonary artery, SL valves open\n- heart sounds\n\t- \"lub\": AV valves closing as ventricles contract\n\t- \"dub\": SL valves closing as ventricles contract\n\n## Control of the Cardiac Cycle\n![[Pasted image 20221111105956.png]]\n\n- sinoatrial node (SAN)\n\t- located in the right atrium\n\t- group of cells that can initiate their own impulse (cardiac muscle is *myogenic* because of this ability)\n\n1) Electrical activity from SAN spreads through both atria—triggering a contraction of the atria.\n2) Electrical activity can't pass through the atrioventricular septum, but can pass through the atrioventricular node (AVN).\n3) A short delay before AVN conducts electrical activity down to the base of the ventricles (ensures atria finish contracting and ventricles are full of blood).\n4) Electrical activity travels to base of ventricles (ensures atria finish contracting and ventricles are full of blood).\n5) Electrical activity travels to the base of ventricles via the bundle of His.\n6) Ventricles contract from the base upwards.\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.620379245Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Disease/CommunicableDiseaseHwk":{"title":"Communicable Diseases Homework","content":"\n\n\na) A communicable disease is a disease that can be spread between organisms via a vector.\nb) ![[pie-chart.png]]\n\nc) 23% = 13 million\n11.5% = 6.5 million\n2.3% = 1.3 million\n\n\n13000000/23 = 565217.3913\n\n565217.3913 x 69 = 39000000.00\n\n39 million from non-communicable per year\n\nWe know that 23% is 13 million, so we can extrapolate from that to discover what 1% is and then multiply that by 69 to find out what 69% is.

Many plants have more sophisticated systems as well, so if a pathogen enters the plant, tylose may be used to block up the xylem to slow or stop the spread through the plant and calose can have a similar blocking effect on the phloem.  In addition, if the epidermis is damaged, then callose and tylose can be used to form a barrier between the outside and the internals. A plant may also isolate leaves, branches of sections of the plant from a water and energy supply, allowing it to die and drop off. This would result in the infected plant section die.\n2) Plants have reactions to different diseases where they produce specifically tailored chemcials to slow or kill different pathogens. These chemical responses also allow for communication with other plants, triggering them to produce toxins. The chemicals produced can also be tailored to harm or deter certain insects or animals, reducing the likelihood of something larger coming and eating the

However, the people who stopped smoking enjoyed a slight increase in their FEV which slowly began to tip downward after 2 years, declining at a much slower rate than that of the smokers who were continuing.\n\nb)i) Cigarette smoke contains many compounds that should not enter the human body due to their detremental effects. Some of these compounds, such as tar will bind up the cillia lining the walls of bronchioles. This cillia is responsible for wafting mucus (which will capture unwanted particles and pathogens) away from the alveoli and out of the lungs. By smoking, you will create a build up of tar in the lungs, slowly disabling the cillia and preventing them from moving the mucus. As a result, mucus and unwanted particles will build up in the lungs. As the cillia is unable to remove them, a coughing mechanism is used to shift the mucus. This leads to peristent coughing. \n\nCoughing can work for a while, however it is a violent motion which can cause damage to the sensitive membranes within the lungs. If you cough too much, you will cause significant damage to tissues within the lungs, further debilitating them.

These are conformational changes.It increases the ability of the enzyme to catalyze a reaction.\n\nThis can be applied to COPD as enzymes similar to those of certain pathogens are also present in elastin. This allows for damage to be made to tissue within the alveoli, as these enzymes will alter their shape slightly to fit into elastin and trigger a breakdown. \n\n2)a)i) Alveoli. There are many alveoli within the lungs because of the requirement of exchange surfaces to have a very high surface area. A single alveolus does not have a surface area high enough to meet the exchange requirements of the organism, so many are required to achieve this goal.\n\nii) Squamous Epithelium\n\n\niii) Elastic fibres allow the alveoli to flex with pressure changes in the lungs and also help to stop the structure from falling apart. \n\nb)i) As diffusion occurs between the air in the alveoli and the blood, the amount of oxygen in the air is continuously being decreased while the amount of carbon dioxide continually increases. If ventillation is not good, then the balance will eventually shift and oxygen will move out of the blood, with carbon dioxide moving in. This would defeat the purpose of the exchange surface, so refreshing the air regularly will both prevent this from occuring and ensure that the rate of diffusion remains high.\n\nii) Specialised cells line the border between the alveoli and the capillary that passes it, these aere called \"squamous epithelial cells\" and are adapted to allow for a shorter diffusion pathway. The cells are stretched out to reduce the distance that substances have to travel between air and blood. The wall here is also only a single cell thick, further boosting the diffusion speed.\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.656380856Z","tags":["biology","exchange","homework"]},"/sixth/Biology/ExchangeSurfaces/TheNeedForSpecialisedExchange":{"title":"The Need for Specialised Exchange Surfaces","content":"\n## Single celled organisms\n\n- exchange gases, nutrients and waste products across outer surfaces because they have a larger SA:V (surface area to volume ratio).\n- low metabolic activity—diffusion via outer surface meets demands.\n\n## Multicellular organisms\n\n- smaller SA:V\n- higher metabolic demand\n- outer surface not large enough for diffusion to meet demands\n- substances have to travel further to reach the centre of the organism\n- require specialized exchange surfaces\n- specialized exchange surfaces: surfaces over which materials are exchanged for another material.\n\n## Features of good exchange surfaces\n\n- increased SA—overcomes small SA:V of organism\n- thin layers reduce distance for diffusion\n- good blood supply creates a steep concentration gradient\n- ventilation—maintains steep concentration gradient for movement of gases\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.656380856Z","tags":["biology"]},"/sixth/Biology/Homework/CatalaseAndHaemoglobin":{"title":"Compare the role and structure of catalase and haemoglobin","content":"\nIn terms of their role, catalase is an enzyme involved in breaking hydrogen peroxide (toxic) down into water (safe, useful) and oxygen (safe, useful).

So the legal team will all work together as part of one team, and the engineering team will work together as a different cohesive unit. A matrix structure focuses more on projects. Whilst people belong to a specific department they also have a project assignment. The work that each individual is given is primarily coming from the project manager, although some instructions will still come from the functional department manager.\n6) Organisational design and structure is influenced by the nature of the business. If the business is dealing with pharmaceuticals, then mistakes **cannot** happen. This means that the business management will be driven towards a more authoritarian structure, with more centralised management. However, if the business offers warehouse storage as a  service, then they will likely be able to operate efficiently on a very laissez-faire structure with lots of decentralisation. This is because it isn't vital that everything is done in the exact same way, and it may improve customer relations. The size of the business is also a big factor, as the larger the business gets, the harder it becomes to maintain effective centralised management. As the burden on the head office grows with every employee that the business gains, if they have thousands of people working at hundreds of sites across the globe, then they are likely to struggle to require a more hands off approach in order to achieve optimum efficiency.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/BusinessMission":{"title":"Business Mission","content":"\n### Mission Statement\n\n- Difficult to define accurately\n- A generalised statement of where you are heading from which objectives can be set\n- A more ambiguous and passionate way of expressing an aim\n\n#### The mission statement is\n\n- the overriding purpose of the business\n- the reason for its existence\n- a strategic perspective\n- supports the stated “vision” for the future\n\n#### The mission statement is not\n\n- a statement of goals or objectives\n- statement of core values\n- how the business intends to compete in the marketplace\n\nSee [Hierarchy of Objectives](sixth/Business/Units/fh/BusinessObjectives)\n\n#### Key audiences for a mission statement\n\n- Employees\n- Customers\n- Investors\n- Society\n\n#### Purpose, Values, Standards, Strategy\n\n- Make up core values\n- Often included in the mission statements, or longer term plans\n\n#### What makes a good mission?\n\n- A clear sense of business purpose\n- Excites, inspires, motivates, guides\n- Easy to understand and remember\n- Differentiates business from competitors\n- For all stakeholders, not just shareholders and managers\n\n\n#### Frequent criticisms of mission statements\n\n- Not always supported by actions of the business\n- Often too vague or general\n- Could just be for good PR\n\n---\n\n### Internal influences on objectives and decisions\n\n- Business ownership – profit or non-profit?\n- The relative power of stakeholders\n- Ethics - decisions made on ethical grounds might reject the most profitable options\n- Business culture – \"the way we do things around here\"\n- Resource Constraints – everyday decisions about deploying limited resources \n\n### External influences on objectives and decisions\n\n- Pressure for short-termism – businesses focus on short-term profit objectives rather than long-term performance objectives due to shareholders demand for return on investment\n- Private limited companies have an easier time focusing on long-term goals than public limited companies, because Ltds typically have closer relationships with their shareholders\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/BusinessObjectives":{"title":"Business Objectives","content":"\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220914095046.png]]\n*The hierarchy of objectives*\n\n---\n\n\n**SMART** - acronym helps management set effective objectives\n\nS - Specific; the objective should state exactly what is to be achieved.\n\nM - Measureable; an objective should be capable of measurement - so that it is possible to determine success.\n\nA - Achieveable; the objective should be realistic given the circumstances in which it is set.\n\nR - Relevant; objectives should be relevant to the people responsible for achieving them.\n\nT - Time Bound; objectives should be set with a time-frame in mind.

Companies are incorporated meaning that they become a separate legal entity from the owners, can sue and be sued in law and the owners of shares have limited liability meaning they can only lose the amount they invested in the business.

Reduces profit.\n\nShare prices are determined by what people think the value of the business is. So a profit warning equals reduced dividend payments and business stability - therefore lower business value.\n\n1) If you start a business without limited liability, and you make a mistake, then you have no protection against anything that happens. You could end up in debt and with your personal assets at risk. Limited liability is a simple way to separate yourself from your business and create that legal barrier between the two entities.\n3) A private limited company and a public limited company are similar in many ways. However, they start to differ at the point where a plc has shares floated on the stock market, whereas a private limited company requires shareholders to be invited. A public company has additional requirements when it comes to publishing accounts and handling additional paperwork (although a private company most definitely still has paperwork). Public limited companies are much more visible to the public, and news outlets will report on their profit filings and activities much more closely. This means that a public limited company will have to be much more careful about their activities than a private one.\n4) A private limited company does not need to publish its accounts, whereas a public limited company does. This is an advantage to setting up as a private ltd, because it means that your financial data is more secure. You will be able to protect information about your cash flow from the public, meaning that it will have a minimal impact on your business. This also enables a business to be more effective at competing with other businesses in the same market, because they will not be sharing their performance information - meaning that they have more room to outwit their competitors.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyEducsupplies":{"title":"Case Study: Eudcsupplies","content":"\n## Explain two methods of employee representation introduced at Educsupplies (6 marks)\n\nEducsupplies introduced a suggestion scheme, allowing employees to provide feedback about the running of the business and their views. The “you said – we did” initiative allowed employees to view the impact of their feedback and gain a sense of importance. \n\nEqually, the director's walkabout enabled direct and instant communication between employees and directors, meaning that the day-to-day issues of an employee could be quickly and clearly communicated to someone from the board. This will lead to many issues being raised with the highest level of management before they have time to develop into something that will lead to dissatisfaction and possible grievances. \n\n\n## Most employees at Educsupplies belong to the recognised trade union. Explain two possible benefits to employees of belonging to a trade union. (6 marks)\n\nBy being a member of a union, employees will benefit from improved negotiations over the likes of pay and working conditions thanks to the collective bargaining that a union can perform. This has already lead to improvements in the mentioned areas for employees, which will help to keep them satisfied with their jobs, leading to lower labour turnover and greater productivity. The union also provides employees with an additional layer of protection or a safety net of sorts, allowing them to feel more comfortable and protected whilst at work. Because of this, employees will have a less stressful working experience, because should something bad happen, they will have a strong organisation to fall back on.\n\n\n## What does the case study suggest are the benefits of employee representation to:\n\n### the employees of Educsupplies (6 marks):\n\nEmployees are free to share their feedback on any element of the business, and know that it will be listened to by management, giving them an increased chance of making changes for the betterment of the workforce. This will enable employees to enjoy greater power in their roles and take up a more integral position within the business. \n\nWhen employees have an issue with their position, they have a direct channel to communicate their problems with the management which will give them the opportunity to resolve any potential disputes quickly and before they become cause for industrial action.\n\n\n### the owners and managers of Educsupplies (6 marks):\n\nEducsupplies has experienced a range of issues recently, and proper employee representation will let them remedy a lot of these problems. Whilst action could be taken autonomously from upper management, it would likely be too broad to address the specific requests of the employees. By incorporating the employees into the decision making processes and taking their suggestions as inputs, these fine point issues can be properly addressed, and the business can cooperate with employees to try and ensure that all issues are resolved in a timely manner with an amicable attitude on both sides. This is much preferable to industrial action, or low employee satisfaction.\n\n\n## The quality of communication is an influence on employer-employee relations. Based on Educsupplies, or any other businesses with which you are familiar, to what extent do you believe the quality of communication is the most important influence on good employer-employee relations? (16 marks)\n\nCommunication is the key to the prevention *and* resolution of issues. Whilst it definitely isn't the only factor to good employer-employee relations, good communication definitely is one of the major ones. Before Educsupplies made changes to their business, they had poor communication between various employer and employee bodies, which lead to a plethora of issues within the organisation. The vast majority of changes that they made to the business were centered around communication, which lead to very favourable results. This suggests that the business was lacking in communication, but it also shows that good communication is important to keeping everything running smoothly.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the quality of communication **is** the most important factor for good employer-employee relations. All interactions and agreements between employers and employees are a result of communication, if both parties are able to engage in this effectively, clearly and respectfully constantly, then issues that could grow into problematic disputes could be dealt with before they risk causing a scene and general sentiment could be kept favourable between all involved parties. This is very beneficial for the business, becuase it means that internal issues won't be dividing employees and causing struggles - leading to greater labour productivity, lower labour turnover and greater product quality. \n\nSo high quality communication impacts every area of the business, and is an essential cornerstone for any organisation to achieve a high degree of efficiency and unity.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyLush":{"title":"Case Study: Lush Cosmetics","content":"\n## What is meant by the term \"target market\"? (2m)\n\nThe target market is the selection of people that the business wishes to sell their products to. They try to tailor their offerings to that demographic.\n\n## State two examples of behavioural segmentation included in the article (2m)\n\n- Celebrity purchases are noted on the website, so people who like to follow celebrities will be more likely to buy from Lush.\n- They also focus heavily on freshness and authenticity of their products, meaning that people who look for quality will be more attracted to their store.\n\n## Analyse two reasons why Lush introduces new products every three months. (9m)\n\nCustomers come to Lush because their products are *fresh*, if they offered the same products constantly then the range would become stale. This would psychologically impact the customers, making them feel that Lush wasn't being fully fresh. By using fresh ingredients and changing their range up frequently, they can counter this.\n\nAlso, fresh ingredients means that products have a short shelf life otherwise they would risk damaging their reputation. This would result in them having to have a short production chain and a quick product turnover in their stores. Therefore, changing their actual products helps to keep things fresh without having much of an impact on their production.\n\n## Analyse two reasons why Lush might have decided to open its own shops when it re-launched the business in 1994? (9m)\n\nLush is “iconic”, their stores are unlike any others. You can smell their stores from a distance, which makes them noticeable. If Lush sold their products in other company's stores, such as a supermarket, they would not be able to utilize such a marketing method. Also, people tend to consider the ethics of the store they are in more that the ethics of the company producing the product that they are buying. By running their own stores, Lush can take their core values such as freshness and reinforce them by designing their stores around their business.\n\nAlso, running their own shops would provide them with greater control over every aspect of their business. When they were selling through The Body shop, they were completely dependent on The Body Shop for all sales. If The Body Shop decided to stop stocking their products, they wouldn't have anywhere to turn. However, if running their own stores they would have greater control. Nobody would be able to cut them out of their own business.\n\n\n---\n## Lush uses market segmentation in its planning.  Evaluate the usefulness of market segmentation in segmentation in enabling Lush to make large profits. (16 marks)\n\nLush utilizes market segmentation to help them focus their product development efforts on the correct target audience. By splitting the market in which they operate into segments, they can identify the people who are most likely to buy their products and ensure that they are meeting all the requirements of these customers. In this sense, the use of market segmentation is a good thing for Lush. However, when they focus solely on certain market segments they may alienate some of their customers. \n\nHowever, the risk that some customers will be excluded may be a worthwhile risk for Lush as they will be able to ensure that they stay focused on their core audience, which will allow them to retain their main customer base and provide a higher quality service to their consumers.\n\nLush achieves high profits through their market segmentation planning by finding quality selling points, such as fresh and natural ingredients, which they then use to make their high markup a reasonable purchase for their target market, which consists of people who are willing to spend more to get a product that ticks these boxes. Because Lush is operating in a fairly niche market, they don't have  a huge amount of competition either, which allows for them to take more risks when it comes to new products, and allows them to continue growing their market share.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyMichellesStressfulJob":{"title":"Case Study: Michelle's Stressful Job","content":"\n\u003e [!failure] Piped content missing\n\u003e\n\u003e Content upload error during build process.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","homework","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyMiyagiMotors":{"title":"Case Study: Miyagi Motors","content":"## Prep\n### Demographic\n- 45 year old\n- £65000\n- Environmentally conscious\n- meet consumer needs\n- target advertising\n\n## Analyse the reasons why Miyagi Motors need to find out the main consumer demographic for the Loris electric car (9 marks)\n\nKnowing the consumer demographic allows a company like Miyagi Motors to know who is buying their existing products, and therefore how they can ensure that upcoming products meet the requirements and wants of their market. If they produce a car that does not meet the needs of their customers, then they will not sell many and will suffer bad PR as well. However, if they do correctly factor in the main demographic for their products then they will be able to increase sales and gain good publicity—a win-win for the business and its clients.\n\nSomething that would be vital to consider when reviewing the main consumer demographic is the financial situation of the individuals. So as the average income of their consumers is around £65,000/annum they will be able to spend more money than the average person, however they are still unlikely to have the target price of £24,000 lying around. This would be a cost that could be offset when the customer considers the reduction in fuel costs after the purchase, and any other features Miyagi includes to improve the perceived value of the vehicle.\n\n## To what extent is consumer income the main external factor affecting demand for the Loris electric car? (16 marks)\n\nWhilst the income of the consumer is a large factor impacting whether they would look to buy a Loris, there are other factors that could have a greater influence. An example of this would be savings—as if someone had a very large sum of money in savings, but a low salary, they may still buy the Loris.\n\nIt is worth considering wider, more general economic factors as well, such as interest rates. Many people will not buy something that costs £24,000 out of pocket, so they will need to borrow money from a bank. High interest rates will increase the long-term cost of borrowing money, and will reduce the probability of someone spending their money on a non-essential item like a nice car. Even if somebody does have a high enough income to afford a new car—they may not wish to do so if they have concerns over the security of their job or the future of the economy.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyNewFrontiersTravel":{"title":"Case Study: New Frontiers Travel launch new pick n mix service aimed at rejuvenating the package holiday market","content":"\n1) New Frontiers Travel have not made any changes to their offerings for a while, however the market in which the exist has evolved significantly. With the rise of the internet new businesses have opened up to provide customers with more convenience and flexibility than what New Frontiers can offer. With increased internet access and usage potential customers have been increasingly looking for more competitive options or booking their holidays themselves, because the people offering travel and accommodation have also moved onto the internet. For a company like New Frontiers, this means that their business model is not going to hold up as it is, and they need to make modifications to their strategy to adapt to this new business landscape. \nThe introduction of their website, NewFrontiers.com, means that they can offer their new, refocused packages to customers in a format that people will be more likely to engage with. Also, the new CEO is recognising that people are decreasingly using physical stores, so the decision to close 199/1069 stores that they have in the UK will likely save the company a fair bit of money. Without these changes, the company will continue to lose revenue and relevance in the market and will face bankruptcy. Their old model worked, but as times are changing, the company needs to move with them.\n\n\n2) Extension strategies are an important method for bolstering the profits of New Frontiers, however they will not be the sole factor required to keep the company in business.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyRyanair":{"title":"Case Study: Ryanair","content":"\n2) The physical environment that Ryanair provides are cut right back to reduce the costs on Ryanair. Whilst this does offer customers very competitive prices. Many customers will expect additional service to be provided, however Ryanair either does not provide these at all or uses them as an opportunity to charge an additional fee.\n\n3) Digital marketing is any marketing that takes place digitally, typically online. This could be anything from social media advertising campaigns to viral videos.  It allows for very rapid, certain marketing. Online people can find and share content much more quickly leading to greatly improved marketing performance. And if an advertising campaign is purchased via a technology company they can typically gaurantee so much reach and interactions. \n\n4) Ryanair achieves penetration pricing partly via their dynamic pricing model, where they will sell the first tickets on a flight at very low prices, and gradually increase the price as more seats fill up. They also provide seasonal offers, where even lower prices are offered (and advertised) allowing for them to appeal to the market as **the** choice for cheap air travel. The impact of penetration pricing is typically stiffling competition and increasing units sold.\n\n5) After Ryanair has sold the first 70% of seats on a flight, they switch from their lower pricing strategy to a price skimming strategy. Ryanair knows that if you have not booked in the first 70%, then you are likely to be somewhat desperate to get a flight, meaning that you will be more likely to pay a higher price, because you just need a flight and don't have the flexibility to choose another flight. Therefore, Ryanair has successfully implemented price skimming across the final 30% of ticket sales for each flight, allowing them to make more money from these customers whilst still typically managing to fill the flight - and give most customers the impression of great prices.\n\n6) Ryanair became established and successful fairly quickly in Europe, and already had a fairly large market share. There is not enough room for two businesses to exist in the very low end flight market. So if SouthWest Airlines moved into Europe, they would have a very high risk, low chance of success battle to beat Ryanair in the market. This is not something that their low cost model would work well with, as it would likely lead to increasing prices in the main American branch.  Therefore, it would not make financial sense for SouthWest to try and enter the European market, however if there are other regions of the world, such as Asia or Oceania where this is a demand for cheap flights, and no business is currently competing in the market then it may be a much better idea for SouthWest to enter that region instead.\n7) Ryanair is looking to increase the quality of the service that they provide to appeal to a greater range of people, specifically the business class.  To do this, one of their focuses is on people. By ensuring that their staff provide a high quality, reliable and friendly experience to passengers, Ryanair will be able to improve the customer satisfaction that they have, giving them the ability to compete with other airlines in different areas other than price. If they can do this successfully, without having to increase their costs or pricing by much, then it could lead to Ryanair becoming a choice for people looking for something more premium as well.\n8) Price elasticity of demand on flights is something that changes. If you are booking a flight 6 months in advance, you are not under pressure to book there and then, so in order to secure a sale, a company such as Ryanair can do this best by offering a lower price to you. However, if you are looking to book a ticket the same week or even same day, then you are just looking for a flight that will take you to the correct place. Ryanair knows this, and is aware that in these cases people will be much more likely to pay a higher price for a ticket than the people who book early, meaning that they can easily push prices up and increase their margin for the final 30% of tickets sold. In other words, Ryanair goes from being one option among many for the early birds, to the only option for people booking late - therefore it is much easier for Ryanair to sell a ticket to the late person than it is for them to sell a ticket to the early one. \n9) Digital marketing is a new strategy that allows for guaranteed reach and much quicker more reactive marketing. If used correctly, it can funnel traffic from major social networks onto the Ryanair website, and it can be used to specifically target individuals who are looking for flights to certain areas. Because of this degree of accuracy that digital marketing offers, Ryanair will be able to get much better value for money on marketing campaigns. Moving to a more technologically based market.\n\n---\n## Hwk: Evaluate the potential difficulties faced by Ryanair in trying to change its marketing mix in order to widen its appeal.\n\nRyanair is trying to shift their focus to more points in the marketing mix because they have now cornered the budget market, using price penetration and skimming to maximise their revenue for each flight whilst ensuring that they get run at a near maximum capacity. So, price is already very well optimised, and they have chosen to only operate between popular destination meaning that their place is fairly wll constructed so far. \n\nHowever, one area where Ryanair has not yet directed their focus is people. Customers looking for a more premium experience will not choose Ryanair because the service that they offer is not premium. One of the main ways that Ryanair could bolster this would be through increasing both the staffing levels on flights and the training of their staff. If there are more staff, then the load on each individual staff member will be reduced and the quality of service that can be provided to each individual customer will increase. With additional training, this will only improve further. \n\nThe physical environment on a Ryanair flight is not something that could particularly be described as luxurious either. As a primarily budget airline, Ryanair has packed their planes with as many seats as possible. This means that leg room, comfort, and other amenities have been significantly restricted. If Ryanair wants to successfully attract a more premium clientelle, then they will have to find a way of offering these services at a slight premium. Likely the best way that they could offer this would be by converting a certain section of the seats on the flight to \"Premium seats\", which would enable customers willing to pay a bit more for the upgrade to enjoy an experience that matches more high end airlines. \n\nIn addition, the process that Ryanair puts customers through is not intended to be luxurious or premium. It is intended to convert as many people to paying customers as possible, and it applies time pressures with their cheaper prices for the first customers and seasonal deals. This means that Ryanair is less attractive than many competitors where you don't have to worry about whether or not you'll get a seat. Because of this, Ryanair may need t ofocus on some form of premium membership, whereby people who pay some form of annual fee will get priority access to their booking system. Allowing them to book seats before they are made avaliable to everyone, and possibly even providing additional services to these customers, such as included meals or discounts on flights. It would be possible to structure this in such a way where Ryanair would continue to make a profit from these customers, whilst also improving the quality to a level where they would be attracting higher tier customers onto their flights.\n\nTherefore, it makes a lot of sense for Ryanair to look at expanding their marketing mix. The process allows Ryanair to significantly bolster their range of offerings, meaning that more people will be attracted to their service. However, it is also important for Ryanair to not loose sight of their core customer base, because these are the people who generate most of the company's revenue, and if Ryanair makes their customers on lower priced tiers feel discriminated against or like second-class customers, then they will risk loosing both positive public relations and customers. So - Ryanair need to expand their marketing mix to improve the experience people offer, the process through which bookings are made and the physical environment provided on their flights, but they do also need to do this in a way that allows them to increases profit, without scaring away existing customers and opening a gap in the market to allow a competitor to enter.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyStayingPrivate":{"title":"Case Study: Staying Private","content":"\n1) Timpson is a successful business with assets worth a lot of money. This makes them vulnerable to the impacts of having unlimited liability, as William Timpson and any other shareholders could be liable for any damages or debts that the company becomes involved in. Because of this, it makes logical sense for the business to move towards something with limited liability. This basic change in business form, whilst it would come with a few negative side effects, immediately protects the owners from a lot of risk. A private limited company would enable the company to fairly seamlessly transition without having to make too many adjustments to the functional structure of the organisation. Another option that might be viable for a company such as Timpson is a public limited company. This business form would bring increased scrutiny over the company, and would allow anybody to buy into the business—good for cashflow, not so great for control. \n\tSo whilst a sole trader isn't a completely unviable business form, it is definitely not a great idea. A private limited company is probably the best match for the business, as William Timpson said that he “would hate … having shareholders telling me what to do”, and a private limited company brings protection without letting anybody become a shareholder.\n\tA sole trader would have been a good place to start, as it is easy to set up, there is a low level of complexity and the assets at risk are fairly unlikely to be lost if it is a small business. Absolute control is given to the business owner.\n\n2) Factors impacting a plc's share price:\n- performance of similar businesses\n- overall economic status\n- profit warnings\n- accounts\n- recent business decisions\n- rumours (ie, layoffs)\n- whether or not the business will become obsolete in future\n- sustainability\n- public opinion\n\n3) When deciding whether or not to remain a private company, Timpson would have considered a wide range of different factors. These would have included the likes of financial stability, as a private company would be much more responsible for financing itself, whereas a public company would have the freedom to raise finance via the sale of shares. Because Timpson wants the company to remain private to give him more freedom over the decision-making aspect, he would have to find a way to justify the financial side of this move, as anybody who wanted to transition to a public company would likely use the financial difference as an argument point. Another important factor in this decision would be the risk of a hostile takeover. As a public company, the business would be very vulnerable as a low share price could leave them open to be bought out by another organisation. This would likely conflict with the interests of Timpson, because he likes retaining control over the business. A loss of control may end up being a worthwhile sacrifice, though, as a public company comes with advantages too. These include the obvious, like being able to sell shares easily, but also less clear benefits like greater public presence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","homework","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyThatsEntertainment":{"title":"Case Study: That's Entertainment","content":"\n\n## Assess the value of the market research carried out by James (9 marks)\n\nJames carried out several forms of market research, which is good because it distributes the sources and helps to verify the authenticity of the data that he gathers. He performed secondary research using a UK-based website. This is good because the data is easily accessible and can be accessed in large quantities. He found that the average cost of a child's entertainer would be about £135—across the UK.\n\nThis information is useful for approximations, however it should not be taken as hard facts. Because of the nature of a website, the data may be outdated, leading to false expectations, and it is also very possible that it doesn't reflect the demographic of James's local area. For instance, because his local area had “high unemployment”, people may be looking to reduce costs by cutting out unessential spending, such as a child's entertainer.\n\nLuckily, he decided to reinforce his findings with primary research, in the form of a questionnaire that he handed out to parents at the local school. With this, he managed to discover that—based on 20 returned surveys—56% of parents had an interest in a child's entertainer, and he found that they were prioritizing quality over price. This suggests that there are good grounds for James to enter the market, especially as only 1 of the local entertainers offers a children's magic show.\n\n\n## To what extent do you agree that the market research James carried out will ensure the success of his new business? (16 marks)\n\nMarket research is unable to ensure anything, it should never be treated as a hard-set market setup, because it is based on samples of sections of a market—it doesn't represent everyone. James got 20 questionnaire responses, and has extrapolated to a larger population from this data. This is an assumption, not a guarantee. It is therefore possible that the people who returned surveys are a minority and that James's business might not get enough traction to to become profitable.\n\nHis secondary market research can act as a reinforcement of the primary research he performed, as parallels can be drawn between the results. For instance, it is possible to see that opinions found on Netmums can be related to those shared by local parents. This can be used to make the educated suggestion that approximately 50% of parents would consider paying for a children's entertainer.\n\nHe has not taken factors such as population size into account. Because if he is only planning on operating in a small region, then the existing entertainers in the region may already saturate the market, and their experience and loyalty may be able to allow them to outcompete James. If this is the case then it may be true that customers have a demand, but the supply would already be provided. He could have improved his research by asking customers whether they had found a child entertainer, and whether that child entertainer had provided everything that they wanted. This would have enabled James to identify gaps in the market and increase his probability of success in a situation where the market is already competitive. \n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.668381393Z","tags":["business","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/DifferentFormsOfBusiness":{"title":"Understanding Different Business Forms","content":"\nBusiness forms typically depend upon some of the following factors:\n\n- Business Objectives\n- Stakeholders\n- Shares \u0026 Shareholders\n- Organisational structure\n\n## Business Form Mapping\nThe private sector is any business that is owned by partners, owners or shareholders.\n\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220915094507.png]]\n\n**Incorporated:** Private Limited Companies and Public Limited Companies\n\n**Unincorporated:** Sole Trader and Partnership\n\n## Business Research: Public Limited Companies\n\nA plc tends to be a fairly established business, as it costs £50,000 to set up (at least) and therefore it is usually a reformed private limited company. Like a private limited company, plcs are owned by shareholders. However, there is a fundamental difference - as the shares of a public company are traded on the stock exchange and can be bought by anyone. This enables the raising of stock capital.\n\nThere are also more high level requirements placed on the business, as more documents must be published - including public accounts.\n\nThis means that anyone can own part of the business if they purchase shares. However, the effective owner of the business is the majority shareholder - if there is one. \n\nDecisions will be made by the executive employees (such as the CEO) and the board (made up of major shareholders). This only covers major decisions, as more minor decisions will still be covered by lower levels of management.\n\nHostile takeovers are a higher risk for public limited companies as anybody is capable of purchasing shares. The setup cost is high, and shareholders will all expect a cut of the profits.\n\nThe shareholders all have limited liability.\n\nA plc is usually a lot bigger than a standard ltd company.\n\nShareholders have ultimate control over the business - however the majority shareholder, if one exists, has complete control. (Anyone with more than 50% of shares.)\n\nHere are some Plcs:\n\n- Admiral Group Plc\n- Aviva Plc\n- BP Plc\n- British American Tobacco plc\n- National Grid\n- Pheonix Group Holdings plc\n- Shell plc\n- Tesco plc\n\n## Business Research: Private Limited Companies\n\nPrivate limited companies can be really small all the way up to a large business. It is the simplest way to form a limited liability company and it has fairly low costs and requirements.\n\nIt only costs £25 to register the company and needs shares to be assigned (if that method is used - persons of signifcant control can also be assigned). A ltd company is typically owned by one (or few) people who set it up. Shares are typically only owned by people directly involved with the company - and share capital is not usually a main source of finance.\n\nWithin a private limited company, the decision making is usually more central than with the typically larger plc. This is because in a private limited company, management is typically much smaller, possibly consisting of a single person. Therefore, a ltd is going to run more like a dictatorship, as one person *could* definitely have complete control over everything.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- owners have limited liability\n- individuals have the opportunity to become their own boss\n- new shareholders must be invited, preventing hostile takeover and divergence of interests.\n- shares can still be sold to raise money\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n- there is frequently a lot of paperwork\n- sometimes financial information may end up being public\n- setup can be time consuming\n- the business may require professional help to manage finances\n\nControl is very central, as the owner of the business may choose to keep the whole organisation under their sole control, or delegate it as they choose.\n\nCorporation tax needs to be paid based on profits - meaning that the company may struggle to keep a positive balance.\n\nThe business is incorporated, and liability is limited - so the owners are protected from having their personal assets lost if something goes wrong with the business.\n\nPrivate limited companies tend to be smaller businesses, however there is no limit to the size of a ltd company - so some of them are very big. \n\n### Examples:\n\n- Contract West Limited\n- The Mill at Harvington Limited\n- Arrowtrack Limited\n- B Car Service Limited\n- Jacana Produce Limited\n- INEOS\n- Home Bargains\n- Thames Water\n- Radius Payment Solutions Ltd\n- Bet365\n\nBusinesses considering changing their form, may need to consider some points covered [here.](sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyStayingPrivate)\n\n## Business Research: Partnership\n\nA partnership is usually a smaller business, owned by a group of partners who usually all have specialisations in an area.\n\nWe frequently see partnerships operating as a firms such as solicitors, lawyers, dentists etc. The business is professional, but geared up to run at a relatively small scale.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- deed of partnership can specify what profits each partner gets\n- they are quick and easy to setup\n- the owners have shared decision making\n- debt responsibility is split between owners\n\n### Disadvantages:\n- they can involve very long hours\n- conflict among owners can occur\n- there is the risk of unlimited liability\n- one partner may let the rest down if they don't uphold the standards of the business\n\nAll partners have shared control.\n\nFinance is provided by the partners, and profit is split between them. The \"deed of partnership\" denotes the specifics of this.\n\nThe business has unlimited liability - putting the partners at high risk.\n\nTypically, partnerships are small and do not grow much.\n\n### Examples:\n\n- JBW law\n- High Street dental practice\n- Merstow Green Medical Practice \n\n## Business Research: Sole Trader\nA sole trader is a common form of business where the owner of the business is the same legal entity as the business. They have unlimited liability, and fairly little legal protection. \n\nA sole trader is owned by a single person who runs the business.\n\nAll of the decision making is made by the singular owner.\n\n### Advantages\n- absolute control to the owner\n- still a legal business, can hire employees etc\n- lower turnover may remove VAT requirements\n\n### Disadvantages\n- unlimited liability\n- personal assets at risk\n\n---\n\nShareholders in **plc** and **ltd** companies can appoint a **Board of Directors** to make the decisions when it comes to running the business. The board appoints management staff of the business.\n\nEvery year, an annual general meeting (AGM) happens for any business. During this time, all shareholders may attend and vote to appoint the board of directors. Shareholder's influence over the vote is dictated by the percentage of shares that they own in the company.\n\nThe board typically aims to get a return on the shareholder's investments into the business.\n\nIn many smaller **ltd** companies, the same people will be shareholders, board members and senior managers in the organisation.\n\n---\n\n## Unincorporated vs Incorporated\n\n### Unincorporated\n- the owner **is** the business - no legal differences\n- owner has unlimited liability for business actions (including debt)\n- most unincorporated businesses operate as sole traders\n\n### Incorporated\n- legal difference between the business and the owners\n- owners/shareholders have limited liability\n- most incorporated businesses operate as private limited companies\n\n### Setting up a plc\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220920140004.png]]\n### Setting up a ltd\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220920140040.png]]\n\n---\nLimited companies have significantly more paperwork than unlimited companies. Accounts will be made public and avaliable for anyone who wants to access them, in a plc. Ltds will not have to have their accounts published.\n\nInvestors look for a return on their investment when they buy shares in a business. They would earn money back from dividends - or shares of the company profits.\n\nDividends can be paid annually or as interim dividends.\n\nThere are also [Public Sector](sixth/Business/Units/fh/PublicSector.md) businesses.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/Distribution":{"title":"Distribution (Place)","content":"\nDistribution is the process of getting a product from the producer to the consumer.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Main objective of distribution\n\u003e\n\u003e To make products avaliable in the right place at the right time in the right quantities.\n\n\n## Distribution Channels\n\nA distribution channel moves a product through the stages from production to final consumption.\n\nEach party in a distribution channel is called an *intermediary*.\n\n![[sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Consumer-Channel-Structure-4015857755.jpg]]\n\n### Wholesalers\n\n- Break bulk\n- Buy large volumes of products at a low price and resell smaller quantities at a slightly higher (but still cheaper than the market) price\n- Retailers can order smaller amounts of product from wholesalers.\n- A wholesaler makes money by buying at a lower price from the producer and adding their profit margin onto the price paid by the retailer.\n\n### Agents\n\n- Specialist type of distributor\n- Does not hold stock\n- Tend to operate in the tertiary sector (services)\n\t- Travel\n\t- Insurance\n\t- Publishing\n- Earn a commission based on sales achieved\n\n### Direct vs Indirect Distribution channels\n\n- Direct Distribution\n\t- Channel where a producer and consumer deal directly with each other without the involvement of an intermediary\n- Indirect Distribution\n\t- Involves the use of intermediaries between the producer and consumer\n\n### Factors to consider\n\n- Nature of the product\n\t- Perishable/fragile\n\t- Technical/complex\n\t- Type of product \n\t- Desired image for the product\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/EconomicGrowth":{"title":"Economic Growth","content":"\n## Market Conditions: Two Key Indicators\n\n**Economic Growth (GDP):** The level of demand in most markets is influenced by the rate of economic growth.

Therefore, to regulate competition, the government may choose to prevent a monopoly by taking action against Amazon.\n\nEconomic factors influencing business strategy:\n\n- Interest Rates\n- Unemployment\n- Inflation\n- Recession\n\nA recession will directly impact the amount of revenue Amazon generates, meaning that Amazon may have to restructure their business model to survive.\n\nIf Amazon does not keep in the loop with social changes, then they will be seen as out of touch and will lose customers.\n\nLegal factors are typically enforced by laws, forcing the company to follow specific regulations.\n\nAmazon has frequently been seen to package items inefficiently, wasting excess plastics and polluting the environment. This means that Amazon has to change in order to retain customers.\n\n[Task](sixth/Business/Units/fh/ExternalVsInternal)\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/ExternalVsInternal":{"title":"External

They operate everywhere—only excluding North Korea. They do not sanction or treat different regions differently, which is seen as both good and bad. For instance, when lots of companies were pulling out of Russia—Valve made no comment or change. However, they do also persist in harder regions - as they have continued all operations in Ukraine.\n\nEconomic - Valve is largely unimpaired by the wider economy as they have created their own internalised Steam economic system. They are definitely still connected to the global economy though - and it does play a big role in their business. However, as they make billions in profit each year, they can afford to loose some of their money and tend not to make a change based on the economic climate.\n\nTechnological - Valve is a high tech organisation, their main product is Steam - a digital game, software and media distribution platform. They also produce games and hardware. This means that Valve tends to be at the cutting edge of technology. They have recently filed patents for BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces), Nerve Manipulating Systems (allowing for the human nervous system to be manipulated to experience different sensations) and for technologies allowing for a false reality to be displayed to a user as a reality. \n\nLegal - Valve is largely unregulated, as many of their business models are yet to be monitored by the law. They do comply with laws, however do also have some business models that are potential risky - such as their microtransaction/gambling models that are used in some of their games. Largely, Valve is an ethical company, paying employees well and providing partners with a good range of services at a very reasonable price. But they are not perfect in this regard.\n\nEnvironmental/Ethical - Valve does not have a written ethical code, however they do react ethically in many situations. When underage gambling sites have existed around their products, they have forced these sites to close down as soon as they became aware of their existence. \n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business","homework"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/InternalVsExternalRecruitment":{"title":"Internal vs External Recruitment","content":"\n## Worksheet\n\n### Compare the process of recruiting internally and externally.\n\nInternal recruitment is beneficial due to the fact that the business has more data about the candidates and can therefore make more informed judgements about who would be a better fit for the business. However, when recruiting internally, it is very likely to create conflict or resentment between employees. This would reduce the efficiency of the business and could break teams apart. External recruitment on the other hand is much more costly and time-consuming, although it does enable the recruitment of someone who specialises in the role that they are applying for, rather than someone who is simply promoting from another role. This means that the role could be filled with somebody more specialised.\n\n\n### Through research and from what already has been covered, evaluate why McDonald's may focus a lot of their recruitment efforts internally.\n\nMcDonald's has a high staff turnover rate, meaning that many employees do not remain in the company for long. However, by making all the roles above crew member something that a crew member can be promoted into means that motivation is boosted for employees and that people in management positions have a better understanding of what employees lower down the chain are experiencing. By recruiting externally, they would lose a lot of these benefits and would possibly reduce the overall efficiency of the business. As a company, McDonald's also likes to create the image that they train up new managers, bringing value to the individuals in their future career and future employers. By doing this, McDonald's can use their internal recruitment strategies to bolster their public relations and gain additional credibility with others.\n\nExternal recruitment would lead to new people appearing higher up in the store's hierarchy, which may make more senior crew members feel cheated out of a promotion.\n\n\n\n## Role of a recruitment agency\n\n- A recruitment agency provides a link between the employer and the employee\n\t- Potential employees register with the agency and provide personal details\n\t- Employers approach the agency for shortlists of potential candidates\n- Recruitment agencies charge a fee for the service\n\t- Main fee is to the employer\n\t- Usually a percentage of employee's wages and salary in the first 6–12 months\n\t- Often an expensive option\n- Some agencies specialise in particular employment areas\n\n\n## What  to consider when advertising\n\n- Type of job\n\t- Senior management jobs merit adverts in the national newspapers and/or specialist management magazines\n\t- Many semi-skilled jobs need only be advertised locally to get sufficient candidates\n- Cost of advertising\n\t- National newspapers and television cost significantly more than local newspapers\n- Readership and circulation\n\t- How many relevant people does the publication reach?\n\n## The Shortlist\n\n- Long list =\u003e Total pool of applicants\n- Shortlist =\u003e Small number of suitable applications that meet the job criteria\n- Should be drawn up by 2 people working independently\n- Import not to only include \"perfect\" or \"ideal\" candidates\n\n### Selection Tests\n\n- Formats\n\t- Aptitude tests\n\t- Intelligence tests\n\t- Personality tests\n- Why\n\t- Basic interview can be unreliable as applicants can perform well at interview but not have qualities or skills needed for the job\n\n## References\n\n- Written character statements from people who know the applicant well\n- An important safety check\n- A chance to learn more about the strengths and weaknesses of an applicant\n- Final check that all information given by candidate is correct\n- Good honest reference from an independent source can also reveal good or bad incidences from candidate's past or particular traits that may have been missed.\n\n---\n\n**Motivation** → The will or desire to do something\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/InterprettingMarketData":{"title":"Interpretting Market Data","content":"\n## Extrapolation\n\nUses trends from historical data to forecast the future.\n\n## Moving averages\n\nA moving average takes a data series and \"smoothes\" the fluctuations in data to show an average.

If a company such as Michelle's decides it needs someone in the reception area and that they need to complete a certain workload, then they will look for the most efficient way to achieve this. In this case, they have assigned a single person to this job, however Michelle is finding it stressful, so it is likely that regardless of how skilled an individual is, the company will need multiple people to be operating the role. Another major factor in job design is the quality of which a task needs completing. For a role like Michelle's, there are many tasks that need to be completed, however for a large amount of them the task only needs completing, it does not need completing to a high quality. Therefore, it is more economically intelligent for her employer to only have 1 person in reception at a time, despite the fact that they may be aware that the worker will be stressed and overwhelmed by the workload. An area of job design that the employer has completely overlooked here is task identity, they have loaded so many different jobs onto the role of the receptionist, that they have blurred the lines between the importance of each individual responsibility.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/MarketMapping":{"title":"Market Mapping","content":"\nA market map is a diagrammatic technique that enables businesses to display the perceptions of customers.\n\nCompares different variables regarding products and consumers.\n\nAllows us to understand how a product or brand is perceived relative to a competitors brand.\n- More ethical?\n- More reliable?\n- More high class?\n\n- It can be used to identify what segment of the market is underprovided for and look at producing a product to fill that gap\n- Typically, products or brands are compared between all competitors within a market\n- Gives a business insight into the competition within the same market as its own product\n\n![[sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20221118104836.png]]\n\n---\n\n1) Market mapping is the process through which the competitors within a market can be compared on several factors.

(male or female, income, education)\n\t\t- Example: 60% of people who shop at a shopping centre are female. Sample size is 400, so 240 females and 160 males.\n\t\t- Women are aged 30-40\n- Stratified Sample\n\t- Stratified sampling is used to select a sample that is representative of different groups.

It is no good employees having loads of benefits if they are still isolated from each other in grey cubicles all day, because they will never have the relationship aspect of hygiene.\n\n#### Argument as to whether Herzberg's two theory motivational factor works\n\n...\n\n---\n\n## Mayo's Human Relations School\n\n### Mayo's Theory of motivation\n\n- Motivation was much more complex than being solely influenced than money\n- Initially believes physical factors made an impact on employee motivation\n\n- Performed the Hawthorne Experiment\n\n### What made him change this mind?\n\n- Hawthorne Experiment\n\t- Seperated workers into two teams\n\t- Altered working conditions of both teams\n\t\t- Increased a physical factor such as light in one team, reduced in another\n\t\t- Analysed results\n\t- Found that employee motivation improved or stayed the same in worse physical environments.\n\n- Conclusion\n\t- Social factors made an impact on motivation much more than physical factors\n\t- Participants productivity increased when they felt valued and appreciated\n\t- Positive relationships betwene managers and employees were found to be key\n\n- Hawthorne's social factors lead to the creation of Human Resources. \n- Term \"Hawthorne Effect\" used to describe how relations with managers increases result in productivity increases\n\t- Some dispute the size of the impact\n\n\n### 3 pros and 3 cons of the human relations theory of motivation\n\n\n- Pros\n\t- Encourages positive workplace relationships\n\t- Individual needs of employees are noticed\n\t- Social factors help to increase the morale, retention, motivation and productivity of employees\n- Cons\n\t- Unscientific approach and original findings lack sufficient supportive evidence\n\t- Ignores the potential impact of conflict\n\t- Oversimplifies human behaviour\n\t\t- Assumes a satisfied worker will automatically be a productive worker\n\n\n### Do you agree with this theory of motivation? \n\nMayo's social factors are definitely an important piece in the puzzle of motivation theory. Alone, they would not be enough to motivate employees, but I believe that if they are combined with several other approaches such as Herzberg's hygiene and motivation factors and Taylorism. The combination of these different theories would enable the spread of benefits to the employees to cover a wide enough range of needs that everyone should be sufficiently motivated to work at what is *at least* an acceptable level. \n\n### Personally, do you prefer Taylorism or Mayo's social factors?\n\nTaylorism focuses mainly on the financial side of things and ensures that employees are paid competitively.  However, Taylorism treats employees more mechanically like a machine whereas Mayo's social factors focus more heavily on the human aspect and allow employees to establish more meaningful links between each other. Therefore, I would personally prefer Mayo's social factors, but I would understand why others may choose Taylorism.\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/NicheAndMassMarketing":{"title":"Niche and Mass

using ACAS\n\n- Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service\n\t- Conciliation\n\t- Mediation\n\t- Arbitration\n\n### Mediation\n\n- Two or more individuals or groups reach a solution that's acceptable to everyone\n- Involves an independent/impartial party\n\n### Conciliation\n\n- Used when an employee is making or could make a specific complaint against their employer to an employment tribunal\n- Conciliator has no authority \n- Both parties work together to try and prevent the need to go to an employment tribunal\n\n### Arbitration\n\n- An alternative to a court of law\n- Held in private rather than in public\n- An impartial outsider being asked to make a decision on a dispute\n- Arbitrator makes a firm decision on a case based on the evidence presented by both sides\n- Arbitration is voluntary, so both sides must agree that they will attend it, and that they will respect the decision of the arbitrator\n\n---\n\n## Improving employer-employee relations worksheet\n\n1) Good employer-employee relations aims to reduce **conflict** through improved **communication** and employees **views** being listened to and taken into account when decisions are being made. Employer-employee relations focuses on these two groups working **together** to achieve the same **objectives**. This is, of course, easier said than done and its success will often depend on the business's **culture**.\n2) Good employer-employee relations lead to:\n   LESS staff turnover\n   MORE Labour productivity\n   MORE motivation\n   LESS industrial action\n   MORE ideas from employees\n   MORE mutual trust\n   LESS absenteeism\n   MORE employee retention\n   \n   \n3) Trade Unions - A group which represent the views of their members. Usually organised by profession/industry. - Through collective bargaining they will represent their member's views and negotiate with employers on issues such as working conditions, pay, redundancies and unfair dismissal. They may carry out industrial action eg, calling a strike.\n   \n   Works councils - Committees including employees (who have been elected by their co-workers) and management who discuss issues which affect the business as a whole. - This provides a forum for employees to communicate with management. \n   \n   ACAS - A publicly funded organisation which offers free and impartial advice to both employees and employers - Aims to resolve disputes between employees and employers and support good relationships through methods such as mediation, conciliation and arbitration.\n\n4) Benefits and drawbacks to employee involvement in decision making\n   \n   Benefits:\n   \n   - Greater employee satisfaction leads to greater support from employees\n   - Employees will raise issues that affect them before they lead to external parties being required\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Employees may hinder the decision making efficacy of the business\n- Managers may be overwhelmed with requests\n\n\n5) To what extent do you agree/disagree with...\n   - Employee involvement in decision making is a good thing\n\t   - Agree\n\t\t   - By involving employees, decisions that affect them can be discussed with them before being finalised, giving them a feeling of control over their situation.\n- Trade unions are something that management should fear.\n\t- Slightly agree\n\t\t- Trade unions shouldn't be an employers best friend, they are there to support the employees above all else. An employer should not be scared of them to the extent that they won't cooperate with them, but employers should try to keep unions on a good standing with themselves.\n- Employee representation is the most important thing a business can do to motivate its employees\n\t- Slightly agree\n\t\t- Individual employees will be motivated by different offerings, some may wish to be excluded from the decision making process entirely. However, by providing the option for employees to become involved, motivation can be boosted for a sizeable portion of the workforce. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/OrganisationalStructures":{"title":"Organisational Structures","content":"\n## Key Words\n\n### Chain of Command\n\n- The \"chain\" of people from an individual moving up the hierarchy. An example might be **Crew member** -\u003e **Shift Manager** -\u003e **General Manager** -\u003e **CEO** \n\n### Subordinates\n\n- A subordinate is someone who is below someone else in a chain of command. You are a subordinate of your manager.\n\n### Span of control\n\n- How many people are under direct management of a single person. If there are few people under the command of an individual, then there is a narrow span of control, but if a manager has large numbers of people under direct control then the span of control is wider.\n\n## Hierarchical Structure\n\n- A hierarchical structure has a very tall organisational structure with many managers. The organisation is highly tiered and there are long chains of command.\n\n### Pros and Cons \n\n- Many layers of management slows communication\n- But plenty of opportunity for career progression\n- Works well for large organisations with many employees\n- If one person is underperforming then the impact could affect many people\n- Long chain of command means instructions may be obfuscated\n\n## Flat organisational structures\n\n- A flat organisational structure has a wider span of control because there are fewer tiers in the organisational structure and each manager has fairly loose control,  meaning that they can have many subordinates.\n\n## Flat structure for large businesses\n\nWhilst a flat structure does come with many benefits, such as greater autonomy for staff, it does require that each individual is fairly highly skilled and has strong motivation. This is because there aren't enough managers to closely control each employee, so every employee has to be trusted to know what they're doing and - for the most part - just get on with it. The issue is if a business has many employees then there are likely some lower skilled employees, and there is a serious chance of managers becoming overloaded, especially if the business is distributed between multiple locations.\n\n## Matrix Structures\n\nA matrix structure is a structure where each individual is a subordinate of two managers. A team will be created to manage a project, where the project has a manager and each memeber of the team is part of a department such as marketing, finance or operations. Employees are under the team manager and department manager. This leads to some dual control.\n\n\n## Delayering\n\n- Taking layers of management out of the organisational structure to flatten the structure.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n- Reduced layers in hierarchy\n- Lower labour costs\n- Increased employee motivation\n- Faster decision making\n- shorter communication pathways\n- wider spans of control\n- greater emphasis on teamwork and empowerment\n\n## Delegation\n\n- Offloading the assignment of authority to subordinates for particular functions.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n- Advantages\n\t- Reduces management stress and workload\n\t- Allows senior management to focus on key tasks\n\t- Subordinates are empowered and motivated\n\t- Better decisions or use of resources (potentially)\n\t- Good method of on-the-job training\n- Disadvantages\n\t- Cannot/ should not delegate responsibility\n\t- Depends on quality / experience of subordinates\n\t- Harder in a smaller firm\n\t- May increase workload and stress of subordinates\n\n\n## Empowerment\n\n- Concept closely linked to motivation and customer service\n- Employees need to feel that their actions count\n- Empowerment is a catch-all term that covers:\n\t- Giving authority to make decisions to front-line staff\n\t- Encouraging employee feedback\n\t- Shows more trust in employees\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/PeCAn-PiE":{"title":"Pecan Pie","content":"\n\n- Pe: Point explained\n\t- Always use words of the question\n\t- Short statement of the point\n- CAn: Contextualised Analysis\n\t- Logical chain of reasoning\n\t- Relevant range of business theory\n- PiE: Point included evaluation\n\t- Not the conclusion\n\t- Develop an “it depends” or “however”\n\t- Is it always the case?\n\nEvaluation hooks: i.e., “essential”.

A price inelastic product will not notice much impact on demand if they increase prices.\n\nPetrol's elasticity depends on factors such as the number of nearby petrol stations, the need of customers to get petrol and various other factors. This means that petrol in a city would be fairly elastic, but fairly inelastic in the middle of nowhere.\n\nPrice elasticity  = % change in demand / % change in price\n\nExample of a product raising prices by 20%:\n\n- Server costs\n\t- May prompt to look for another provider\n\t- Current provider has several USPs, meaning that migration would likely be too much of a hassle\n\n---\nPrice elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in the price. We normally assume that a rise in price results in a fall in demand. The level of elasticity depends upon several factors including: the number of substitutes in the market which make it possible for customers to switch, whether the good is a necessity or a luxury and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/PricingConsolidation":{"title":"Pricing Consolidation","content":"## Practice Exercise 1\n\n1) Goods that are purchased and consumed regularly by a lot of customers and tend to be sold at low prices are: convenience goods.\n\n4) In the Boston Matrix, the difference between a cash cow and a dog is that a cash cow produces a large amount of profit and is likely in the mature stage of the product lifecycle. Whereas a dog is likely in the decline stage of the product lifecycle and is becoming a cost for the business with little future potential.\n5) Some products are called cash cows because they produce lots of profit and require minimal work from the business. A cash cow has likely gone through several other stages already, and it is now established in the market, being a leader in the industry.\n6) A product's USP might be its price, if it has the lowest price in the market, then it has an advantage over every other product in that market. A more reliable long-term USP for a product such as a microwave might be some additional functionality. Maybe it can detect the food put inside it and then automatically set itself up to cook the food.\n10) Introduction, Growth, Maturity, Decline\n11) Typically, the most profitable stage of the product lifecycle will be the maturity stage. By this point in time, marketing costs will be reduced, existing loyal customers will exist, and the brand will be well-known. This means that the business has lower costs for the product than it did in earlier stages, whilst it likely has a larger market share—leading to this being the most profitable stage.\n13) Extension strategies can keep a product on the market longer, delaying its decline. Extension strategies might include rebranding (changing the name and packaging of the product to make it seem like something new), dropping the price to improve the value for money of the product or a more extensive approach would be to update the product, giving it a more modern design and possibly even new features.\n\nAn example of a real life extension strategy would be NVIDIA releasing new drivers for an existing GPU, providing their existing products with additional functionality, therefore adding value and increasing sales.\n\n\n## Practice Exercise 2\n\n1) Psychological pricing is pricing that is intended to disguise the price of a product. For instance, if you charge £100 for a product, it sounds like more than £99.99, even though there is basically no difference. Therefore, when a business uses psychological pricing, they can typically increase sales.\n2) a) 50p + 60p + 70p = £1.80 + 100% = £3.60\nb) 55p + 60p + 70p = £1.85 + 80% = £3.33\n\n3) A company may use price skimming if they are producing a new product that is perceived to be desirable or luxury when they first introduce it into the market. Price skimming involves adding a very large markup to the cost of the product during the first stage of its product lifecycle. During this phase, the sales of the product will be lower than in future however the profit per sale will be at its highest. Apple uses this strategy with new iPhones as do companies like NVIDIA with new hardware releases.\n4) Penetration pricing significantly undercuts competitors, meaning that your product will stand out as the cheapest by far. If it can come close to the quality of the competition, then it will rapidly gain market share and a positive customer reputation – forcing competitors to lower prices or compete in another area.\n5) A price leader is a product that can set the market price. A company like Apple can choose what they charge for products because they know that people will pay for their latest product because some people associate themselves with Apple and their ideologies, meaning that they are willing to pay an unreasonable amount of money for an Apple product—even though a similar product is provided by another company at a much lower price. A price taker is a company that has no option but to follow the price leader's pricing in order to stay in business.\n6) A loss-leader is a product that is sold at a loss in order to get customers to enter the product's ecosystem. By doing this, the company can lock you in to making future purchases with them, and they can charge an additional markup on these purchases to recoup the costs of the loss-leader.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/ProductLifecycle":{"title":"Product Lifecycle","content":"\n1) convenience goods\n2) speciality goods\n3) 70% of new products fail within 3 years because entering the market is the most difficult part of a product lifecycle. In order to enter the market, the product needs successful marketing and to meet the needs or wants of the consumers in order to gain enough recurring sales for the product to be deemed profitable. If the product cannot break through this initial barrier, then it will end up being a drag for the businesses revenue and will have to be discontinued. Also, there are some products that may not be intended to last more than 3 years. Many craze products such as Loom Bands and Fidget Spinners didn't need to last 3 years to make the companies producing them a huge amount of money. So it isn't vital for some products to last 3 years, whilst some more expensive products may need to last for a long time to be seen as successful, such as a watch. If the company stops selling them after 6 months then they seem like a low value product.\n\n![[sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20221212110441.png]]\n4) A star has a very rapid growth rate and a high market share—this makes it the top of the market and suggests it is a desirable/popular product.

These are funded by central or local governments, but may still levy charges for some services.\n\nExamples: NHS, Highways Agency\n\n## Public vs Private sector\n\nPrivate sector companies frequently work to generate profit above all else. However, private sector works to provide a service or selection of goods **for all**.\n\n## Not For Profit Organisations\n\nNot for profit businesses trade to benefit the community. These businesses have social aims as well as trying to make money.\nExamples of social aims are job creation and training, providing community services and fair trade with developing countries.\n\n### Example: Divine Chocolate\n\nDivine chocolate ensures that they pay fair prices to the farmers in Ghana that produce the cocoa. This allows for investment to be made into the local community—improving sanitation and infrastructure. Divine chocolate does not exploit the farmers, whereas historically many have been exploiting by western businesses.\n\n## Case Study: Horbury Plc\n\n1) Horbury had been impacted by economic pressures in the UK, as they sell products in industries such as “music, entertainment, travel, and lifestyle” which are not classed as essential by many. Because of the economic status of the UK at this time people would have had less money to spend, and would have needed to prioritise the purchase of essentials, such as food, mortgages etc. As people would not have been purchasing electronic goods, Horbury plc would have experienced lower sales – resulting in reduced profits or increased losses. Due to this reduction in business performance, shareholders may have been spooked and panic sold shares to recover some of their capital, thus reducing share prices.\n2) For the board to buy the company back and make it private, they would need a significant amount of funding. Whilst the board probably controls a large portion of the company already, it wouldn't be cheap to buy back the rest of the shares. Something that could be beneficial to Horbury going private is that they would gain more control, as they would have shares locked into a group of known individuals. They wouldn't have random investors controlling shares in the company, as every shareholder would have to be invited. This would allow them to benefit from longer term shareholders, who have an interest in the business greater than the chance of making a profit. \n\tAs a private company, Horbury would be under reduced scrutiny as they would no longer have to publicly release as much information about their business, and would be analysed less. However, it would be important for the board to understand that as a public company they can raise capital through the sale of shares, which becomes a much lengthier process if they become a private company—meaning that changing business form would impact their ability to raise capital.\n\tThe company wants to diversify into more markets, and as a private company, they wouldn't be subjected to the whims of the shareholders as much. Instead, Horbury would be able to follow their own internal objectives without being worried about the share price.\n\n\tIn conclusion, Horbury should consider the pros and cons of each option, and take into account their current business plans and financial status before they commit to either decision. If they believe that it is worth it for them long-term, then they should become a private company. However, if they are looking to be able to raise capital quickly, then they should think twice before changing business form.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/RealIncome":{"title":"Real Incomes","content":"\n**Real incomes** measure the amount of disposable income available to consumers (eg, households \u0026 individuals).\n\n### Factors impacting real incomes:\n\n- inflation\n- wage growth\n- employment levels\n- interest rates\n- tax policies\n\n\nHousehold income is only one factor that impacts consumer spending.\n\n### Impacts of lower interest rates\n\n- Costs of servicing loans / debt is reduced—boosting spending power\n-  Consumer confidence should increase leading to more spending\n- Effective disposable income rises—lower mortgage costs\n- Business investment should be boosted eg, prospect of rising demand.\n- Housing market effects - more demand and higher property prices\n- Exchange rate and exports - cheaper currency will increase exports\n\n### Impacts of higher interest rates\n\n- Cost of borrowing rises\n- Main effect will be through mortgages \n- Add contraction in retail credit\n- Repayments on other debts\n- Possible slowdown in housing market\n- Higher rates might also cause currency to get stronger\n- Makes UK exports more expensive in overseas markets\n\n## Demographic Factors\n\nDemography is concerned with the size and composition of a population. Changes in population dynamics occur slowly but can be significant for business.\n\n## Practice Exercise 2\n1) Explain terms\n\t- interest rates—the reward for saving or the cost for borrowing\n\t- market conditions—factors that impact the market a business is operating in\n\t- demographic factors—the makeup of the population that the business is operating in\n\t- environmental issues - whether a business can operate in an environmentally friendly way.\n2) Competition will split customers in the market between the competing businesses—this will reduce the revenue of individual businesses, and require them to adapt and outwit their competition to become dominant. This will increase the costs of the businesses. Equally, the demand for goods or services provided in the market will likely increase due to marketing campaigns, however the demand for a specific business's services may decrease if they are not successful in their marketing efforts.\n3) If the average income of the population is decreasing in terms of value (not necessarily numbers), then the  amount of disposable income people have will decline. This will result in less money being spent on non-essential or luxury items—causing these businesses to suffer from reduced revenue. Additionally, it will increase the chance of people opting for cheaper products when they have multiple options. So lower income will reduce the demand for luxury items, which will in turn reduce the revenue of businesses producing such items.\n4) If interest rates decline, then people with debts or mortgages will have less to pay back, and will therefore have more disposable income. This will lead to greater consumer spending. However, the long-term implication of this is that people saving will be making lower returns on savings—resulting in possible economic issues for them in future. If people were on a tighter budget before interest rates dropped, they may now have more money available to spend—resulting in an increased demand for luxury items and/or services. It is also possible that the demand for very cheap items will fall off—because people will be willing to spend their money on quality.\n5) If a business relies on borrowing money or trade credit to function, then higher interest rates will increase the amount that the business has to pay back on these borrowings. This will directly impact the costs of the business, and will possibly force the business to restructure their finances. Higher interest rates will also impact the customers that the business relies on to generate revenue, possibly forcing them to spend less or move to cheaper competitors. So when interest rates are high, it becomes important to consider costs to their customers, as if they are charging too much they may experience a sharp decrease in sales.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/SWOTAnalysis":{"title":"SWOT Analysis","content":"\n### What is SWOT analysis?\n\n- A method for analysing a business, its resources and its environment\n- Often used as part of strategic planning\n- Looks at\n\t- Internal **S**trengths\n\t- Internal **W**eaknesses\n\t- External **O**pportunities\n\t- External **T**hreats\n\n#### Personal SWOT Analysis\n\n- Strengths\n\t- Technical ability\n\t- Motivation\n\t- Enthusiastic\n- Weaknesses\n\t- Over reaching\n\t- Repetitive tasks such as revision are difficult\n- Opportunities\n\t- Could get involved in open-source and build up a CV\n\t- Could get a part-time job\n\t- Could set up a small online store \n- Threats\n\t- Hard to stand out\n\t- Burnout\n\n### SWOT Analysis aims to discover\n\n- What the business does better than the competition\n- What competitors do better\n- Whether it is making the most of the opportunities available\n- How a business should respond to changes in its external environment\n\n### The SWOT Matrix\n\n- Positive factors\n\t- Strengths \n\t- Opportunities\n- Negative factors\n\t- Weaknesses\n\t- Threats\n\n### Internal vs External\n\n- Strengths and weaknesses\n\t- Internal to the business\n\t- Relate to the current situation\n- Opportunities and threats\n\t- External to the business\n\t- Related to changes in the environment which will impact the business\n\n### What are strengths?\n\n- Market share\n- Economies of scale\n- High quality\n- Leadership skills\n- Financial resources\n- R\u0026D capabilities\n- Technological representation\n- Brand reputation\n- Protected IP\n- Distribution network\n- Employee skill\n- High productivity\n- Flexibility of production\n- etc etc\n\n### What are weaknesses?\n\n- A source of competitive disadvantage\n\n- Low market share\n- Inefficient plant\n- Outdated technology\n- Poor quality\n- Lack of innovation\n- A weak brand name\n- High costs\n- Cash flow problems\n- Undifferentiated product\n- Inadequate distribution\n- Quality problems\n- Low productivity\n- Skills gap\n- Unmotivated staff\n- etc etc\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/SegmentationTargetingAndPositioning":{"title":"Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning","content":"\nMarket segmentation involves dividing a market into parts that reflect different customer needs and wants.\n\n## STP model\n\n- Segmentation\n- Targeting \n- Positioning\n\n---\n\n### What is market segmentation?\n\nThe process of splitting the market into different demographics to help gauge where customer needs and wants.\n\n### Behavioural Segmentation\n\nAnalysing a market based upon factors such as habits like purchase frequency, method of purchase and other characteristics.\n\n### Geographic Segmentation\n\nDefining market categories based upon where people live.

It is also possible for them to collect dividend payments from a profitable business that they hold shares in.\n\n## One influence on share price\n\n- Competitor actions – a competitor announcing a new, better product may cause investors in your business to sell their shares in a panic, leading to a decline in your share price.\n\n## One reason why a business would change ownership model\n\n- If a business has grown, then it would be beneficial to them to change to a better ownership model, so a sole trader may change to a private limited company in order to gain the benefit of limited liability.\n\n## Difference between private \u0026 public sector\n\n- The private sector is run by companies\n- The public sector is run by the government \n\n## What is the relationship between mission and objectives?\n\n- Mission is the overall goal of the business. Many businesses have a mission statement that is very high level and long term.\n- An objective is a much more short term and low level target for the business. These are typically very precise and are easily measurable. \n\n### 5 possible business objectives\n\n- Break-even by Q2 2023\n- Increase the revenue of the clothing department by 20% before the end of the year\n- Sell all the stock in warehouse 2 before it closes \n- Release a new smartphone that sells at least 20 million units before the end of Q3\n- Reduce HR complaints by 50% before the end of the year\n\n## Why would someone set up a not-for-profit business?\n\n- A not-for-profit business is typically created to further the interests of humanity as a whole. Maybe the business will work to reduce hunger around the world or they will simply want to provide an ethical alternative to an existing product, and prioritise the ethics over the capitalist desire to make money.\n\n## The Hierarchy of Objectives (descending)\n\n- Mission Statement(s)\n- Corporate Aims\n- Corporate Objectives\n- Functional Objectives\n\n## Why would a business write a mission statement?\n\n- To provide stakeholders with a view of where the business aims to be in the future\n- To guide all internal objectives\n- To hold themselves to certain standards\n- To ensure that they follow a specific long term vision\n\n## Why is profit so important to a business?\n\n- Profit is an undisputed sign of success\n- Profit allows for dividend payments, which would appease shareholders\n- Retained profit is arguably the best source of finance\n- Profit makes it easier to gain new investments\n\n## Explain how external factors impact cost and demand\n\n\n### Competition\n\n- A strong competitor will reduce demand for your product and will also force you to reduce your price\n- A weak competitor will allow you to push them out of the market with superior price and/or quality\n\n### Market conditions\n\n- If the demand for your product decreases, maybe masks after the COVID-19 pandemic, then there is no longer enough space for all the businesses that exist in the market. \n- Whereas if you are at the start of a pandemic, the market for masks would grow rapidly, leading to businesses having to scale their production up and become more competitive as others try to enter the market.\n\n### Incomes\n\n- If the incomes of the population are rising, then employees will expect to be paid more for working for you. In order to remain a competitive employer, you will need to provide a pay rise.\n- However, if people have more money in general, then you may be able to increase the selling price of your product, which will possibly offset the increased wage costs.\n\n### Environmental\n\n- Consumers are increasingly focused on choosing a sustainable option. \n- By ensuring that you have clearly marketed environmentally conscious policies, you can glean customers from the competition\n\n### Interest Rates\n\n- Higher interest rates will make it more expensive to take out loans and owe money to other parties.\n- Lower interest rates will have the opposite effect.\n\n### Demographic\n\n- Targeting the correct demographic for the product will lead to an increase in demand and perceived value, allowing you to get more sales and charge a higher price. \n- Effective market research can result in good demographical decision making.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/WhatIsABusiness":{"title":"What Is A Business?","content":"\n## Definitions\n\nA business is an organisation that exists to provide goods and services on a commercial basis to customers.\n\nGoods are physical products that can be traded.\n\nServices are intangible products, a task is fulfilled by a business to save someone without the time, expertise, or the equipment the effort of sorting it out themselves.\n\nThey come in many [forms](sixth/Business/Units/fh/DifferentFormsOfBusiness.md)\n\n## Benefits to society\n- Sustain economy\n- Creates jobs\n- Increases consumer spending\n- Tax\n- Provide amenities\n- Drives innovation\n- Increased (international) investment\n\n[Public Sector](sixth/Business/Units/fh/PublicSector) businesses tend to exist to benefit society.\n\nBusiness's begin their corporate life as a startup, more information on startups can be found [here](sixth/Business/Units/fh/WhatIsAStartUp.md)\n\n[Business](/Business)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.672381572Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/WhatIsAStartUp":{"title":"What Is A Startup?","content":"\n**Key Term:** A start-up is a new business enterprise, formed by one or more entrepreneurs.\n\nEntrepreneur:\n\n- A catalyst for the creation and grwoth of a business\n- fulfill their dreams\n- calculated risk taker\n- organise all the resources\n- find and fill gaps in the market\n\n## Case Study: Olio\n\nAn app that deals with improving waste management in the modern world. \n\n- Part of the solution\n- about carbon footprint, ethics, net 0, level target\n- app - tackle waste by connecting neighbours\n- 30,000+ volunteers\n- Food in 21 minutes (people can send and receive food for free within this time)\n- Nonfood less than 2 hours (same as food, but for shampoo etc etc)\n- Founded by Tessa Clarke\n\n\nAims:\n\n- improve the app\n- B-B proposition\n- international expansion\n- 1 billion user by 2030 \n\nInvolving restaurants, supermarkets, food distributors to reach net 0 waste\n\n\n- 6 million users\n- Their aim is for their customers to be part of the solution, and not just contribute, as to make the system a whole lot stronger and to bring about awareness of food waste.\n\n**Key Term:** A mission is a qualitative statement of the business aims.\n\n**Key Term:** An aim is a long term plan from which objectives are derived.\n\n**Key Term:** An objective is a target which must be achieved in order to realise the stated aim.

This suggests that KPM has room to increase their output without pushing contingency margins too hard. New workers are inefficient until they have got integrated into the organisation fully, so turnover is bad for productivity in the factory. Luckily, the company is already addressing this as the turnover rate is reducing significantly.\n\nHowever, last year they were operating at 99% capacity, so the utilisation has dropped off significantly. KPM has clearly invested in improving the overall condition of their facilities, as well as capacity, but they have not scaled appropriately and now have wasted capacity. This is reflected by the higher unit costs this year. It would make sense for KPM to make the decision to employ more people in the factory, as a way to increase the capacity utilisation. Or if they felt that they did not need the extra capacity, they could reduce costs and scale back to a lower total capacity. This would be unlikely to be a good idea due to to the growing demand for their services. \n\n## To what extent do you agree that the decision to increase capacity from 545 tonnes to 830 tonnes was correct for KPM (16 marks)\n\nI do not believe that this increase in capacity was a good move for KPM. An increase in capacity was necessary, however they may have been overzealous in their increase, as they now have idling resources. Of course, we do not have information on their expected growth, so if they are expecting growth to continue rapidly, or a large spike in capacity demand, then running at 71% capacity may be a good choice for KPM.\n\nFor instance, if the extra capacity is the reason deliveries on time has increased by 6%, then they may see it as a worthwhile sacrifice because it will help their reputation. But the idle resources in the factory could be the reason, or part of the reason, behind the increase in unit costs. KPM are currently dealing with competition, which they have been managing to outcompete in pricing. Therefore, it is vital for KPM to ensure that their costs remain as low as possible, to enable them to profit from selling goods at a low price. Unused factory capacity will contribute to rising costs, which will increase the strain on their pricing model. If KPM falls behind in pricing, they will face a decline in sales and market share—which could be fatal for the business.\n\nBecause of the somewhat precarious situation the business is in—the main objective should be managing competition and retaining or growing market share. It may be wise to temporarily reduce capacity. If possible, turning machines off when they aren't actively required, they could reduce their capacity to lower costs. \n\nAnother issue that KPM needs to consider is that the paper industry is in decline globally as everyone moves towards a digital solution. This means that the lifespan of the company is limited and if the market is shrinking, they need to diversify. Diversifying into another market could help save KPM from dying along with the paper industry, however if their plan is to diversify then they should focus on that rather than increasing factory capacity. The large multi-million pound investments in state-of-the-art machinery and new premises may not have been a wise choice, as these resources may have been better spent on migrating towards a new industry.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many different choices KPM could make, however the increased capacity is unlikely to be a good move in the long run due to market decline.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.680381929Z","tags":["business","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CaseStudyDaihatsu":{"title":"Case Study: Daihatsu","content":"\n## To what extent is cutting prices a good way for any business to respond to a fall in the overall capacity utilization in its industry? (16m)\n\nWhen capacity utilization falls in an industry, it suggests that the overall demand🌟🌟🌟 for the products produced by that industry has also fallen. This usually suggests that the business is operating in a market that produces luxury goods, such as Daihatsu producing their small cars. 🌟\n\nBecause people do not need the industry to survive, the only realistic option🌟🌟 for businesses trying to exist in that market is for them to offer lower prices to consumers. A lower consumer price point means that regardless of the state of the economy or the consumer's personal finances, people will be more likely to purchase the business's goods.\n\nThis response will result in revenue being kept as high as possible for the business, which will be very important for keeping things afloat.\n\nThe problem that arises for a business such as Daihatsu offering lower prices is that due to their customizations, they cannot mass produce whole cars, meaning that their unit costs will already be higher than most of the industry. Because of this, they will be subjected to higher costs meaning that reducing their prices may require them to sacrifice some of their USP by reducing the customisability of their cars. Whilst this may be damaging to the business, it is likely that they would be able to continue operation as they would retain their reputation and grow their potential customer base. \n\nEffectively, businesses in industries where overall capacity utilisation is falling need to shift their focuses to different parts of the market to ensure that their longevity is secured. Cutting prices is a good way to reduce the impact of higher unit costs, meaning that for many businesses it will be a viable option.\n\n---\n# Feedback\n\n- Good, but narrow\n- Mention price elasticity of demand\n- Consider demand falling for short term\n\n🌟 Not necessarily\n\n🌟🌟 Really?

(9m)\n\n1) Sarah wants to introduce quality assurance into the business as it will help to improve the business reputation because customers will receive less faulty goods. It will also help to identify problem areas in the production process, helping the business to eradicate resource drains. \n\nAs quality assurance is a constant process that exists throughout the entirety of production, it would also allow faults to be stopped as soon as they are found, meaning that the business doesn't have to waste materials and employee time working on a faulty product. \n\nA side effect of the quality assurance implementation will be to introduce a sense of increased responsibility upon all employees. This will be because they now have an expanded job role which gives them more insight into the running of the organisation. A positive for the business will  be that many people may see themselves as more closely linked/important to the business, however there  is a chance that employees will see the increased responsibility as a chance to demand additional pay—adding costs to the business.\n\n## To what extent do you agree with Jamie’s view that Passion for Fashion’s competitiveness depends on the quality of the design of its clothes?  (16 marks)\n\n2) Passion for Fashion is operating in the clothing market, towards the mid end of the pricing range. This means that customers will expect quality. Especially in the current economic climate, it will be likely that any shortfalls will have a negative impact on the business, even if they are quick to resolve any issues.\n\nTherefore, the importance of quality is paramount to the business's competitiveness. And the easiest way for the business to ensure quality is to use quality assurance. This methodology will maximise the number of people and time spent on searching for issues, meaning that any problems that impact a client should realistically be spotted and corrected or stopped before any faulty goods leave the production line.\n\nIf they deliver a faulty product to a client, then it means that the business's reputation will be at risk. If somebody decides to post the faulty product on social media, it could have the potential to seriously damage the company's business.\n\nBy delivering consistent quality to their customers, they can also create themselves a reputation where they are seen as a higher quality brand, which will give people a higher perceived value and lead to them being able to charge greater prices for their products.\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.680381929Z","tags":["business","homework","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CaseStudyPerfectPaper":{"title":"Case Study: Perfect Paper Plc","content":"\n## With reference to the Tannenbaum Schmidt continuum and Blake Mouton Grid, analyze what type of manager Jayne is. (9m)\n\nJayne has received instructions from her superiors and has made a decision to remedy the situation. However, when interacting with her employees, whilst she does listen to feedback, she does not take it on board. To make this work, she likely has to compromise with her subordinates to keep morale up. This places Jayne on the **Task Manager** corner of the Blake Mouton Grid - giving her a significant focus on achieving goals above anything else. Jayne does not adapt her plans based on the requests of her employees. She is told that some staff members may not be happy with travelling long distances (such as Scotland to London) for various reasons, including them being parents of young children. Whilst she does justify her decision as helping to prevent redundancies - she does not adapt it.\n\nIn a similar sense, she falls under the authoritarian segment of the tannenbaum schmidt continuum. This is because she has centralized the decision-making process, and is giving very little control to the people who her decision will impact. \n\nThis does not make Jayne a bad manager, however it does mean people may not feel comfortable around her or taking their problems to her. But at the end of the day, Jayne is not trying to create a Paternalistic environment, all she is focused on is the results. If she can get good results, then her subordinates keep their jobs and everyone can be happy. Because of this, Jayne could be seen as a good manager, but one that works employees hard.\n\n**Feedback:** Tells or Sells? First paragraph is strong, tannenbaum schmidt needs to be more precise.\n\n## To what extent might a change in Jayne's leadership style improve sales volume? (16m)\n\nUnder her current style, she will be suppressing the creativity of her employees. This is because they will feel like they just have to follow her orders and do everything to the letter. As they are working in the sales team, creative freedom will allow for new ideas to come to fruition and will allow all 25 members of staff to benefit the team at a higher level. However, on the flip side, moving to a different model, such as the democratic one, would have other effects than increasing the diversity of ideas. Some people may be less productive with more freedom, and some of the ideas that the team comes up with may not work out. Luckily, with a greater range of ideas the team is more likely to have a few good ones - whereas previously they would have been stuck with trying to make a single idea work.\n\nIf Jayne were to take this to an extreme and take a more Laissez-faire approach to leadership, she would be taking a much higher risk, but also possibly looking at a much higher potential reward. As long as the team she is managing consists of skilled people whom are capable of working well indepndently from each other, then she should be able to increase productivity by taking a backseat on some of the decision making. \n\nDespite all the potential positives of a more relaxed management style, her current approach with her new plan may be just as, if not more, successful. Jayne is a good sales person, who has been promoted to her position for a reason - and therefore the company has trusted her to do a good job. Whilst sales have decreased since last year, this may not be reflective of sales efforts and simply due to an increasingly digital world. Jayne does have a plan, and as long as she can ensure her team executes it effectively - it should have some success. \n\nIn conclusion, Jayne may be perfectly fine where things are - and would be taking the least risk by changing nothing. However, moving towards greater employee freedom may be incredibly beneficial and boost productivity more than Jayne could manage under her authoritarian style. The problem with a new approach is that the outcome is unknown - so the risk is high.\n\n**Feedback:** Good understanding. To get higher marks, make less points and go into more detail. Also needs evaluation.\n\n## Leadership Styles Research\n\n**McDonald's**: They have an effective leadership style, because staff working there are typically low skilled. So they delegate from a business manager to a general manager, and then down to shift managers who give instructions to the crew members. As you move higher up the ladder, it becomes less authoritarian as a higher skill level is assumed. This does cause some issues, but most of them are minor and can be easily resolved.\n\n**Nando's**: Managers are reportedly very imposing and stressed. They are not paid much more than the lowest level workers, but are given a lot more responsibility and are expected to run everything. This results in the managers not caring much for the business or their work and results in a more impoverished management style. Becuase of this there are employees who do not feel satisfied with the Nando's management style.\n\nA significant amount of data for this research was found on [Breakroom](https://breakroom.cc)\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.680381929Z","tags":["business","homework","casestudy"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CaseStudyScalingUpForThePlantCurious":{"title":"Case Study: Scaling up for the plant curious","content":"\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e These are draft answers.\n\n\n## Explain how the growth of Allplants might have benefitted from its status as a private limited company (4m)\n\nThey were able to gain share capital by selling shares to venture capitalists, allowing them to gain a significant amount of funding.

Whilst there may be drawbacks, such as traffic influxes and rubbish management issues - these will probably be seen as worth it for the availability of more amenities and essentials.\nA large factor that may impact the community views on this proposition is the presence of local businesses that are involved in similar markets to Roxio. If there are a few small, independent shops in the town or village, then Roxio may be viewed as being monopolistic by trying to dominate the market. However, it may be that there is a severe lack of shops, or that the market overlap is not absolute - which would result in Roxio still being able to enter the area without causing friction with the locals.\n\n\n2) Whilst Roxio does initially need to please shareholders, they shouldn't overlook the other stakeholders, nor their combined power. Individually, the shareholders have the most influence over the business, but the customers and employees are both vital to it being able to function, and either group could cease operation of the business. Therefore, it is important for Roxio to prioritize the needs and wants of all of their stakeholders proportionately. Only by properly understanding where people stand with relation to the business will Roxio be able to develop their plans. \nTherefore, Roxio should listen to the complaints of the local communities that they are looking to enter, and instead of ignoring them, they should take steps to meet a compromise. If they appear as a human organisation rather than a robotic one, people will be more likely to accept their presence, even if they initially opposed it. \n\nFurthermore, the government is a powerful entity that could have a massive impact on the business. Roxio should take steps to ensure that the government concerns about their market share do not result in any major action against the company. Again, this will likely result in compromise such as them having to slow their growth plans to fall below the radar of government monitoring agencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the shareholders are only one stakeholder group - in a business the size of Roxio's it is important that they are taking appropriate time to understand and meet the needs of all of their stakeholders. Whilst they may choose their shareholders as priority #1, they cannot be priority 1/1.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.680381929Z","tags":["business","homework"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CashFlowForecasting":{"title":"Cash Flow Forecasting \u0026 Management","content":"\nLiquidity is important.

(16 marks)\n\nThe Eden Project produced a large, detailed budget based on information that they had researched, allowing them to easily approach investors with a plan, showing what they were doing and how they planned to achieve it. Through this method, they managed to provide security to potential investors, ensuring that they are aware of the costs and where money was being allocated. Because of this, more money was given to The Eden Project, ensuring the success of the scheme.\n\nAs they managed to ensure their budgeting was accurate, they reduced the budget variance, meaning that they didn't need to take drastic actions to ensure that they had enough money to complete the project.\n\nAlthough their budget did have variances in it, they quickly disclosed these to the Millennium Commission which agreed to cover some of the additional costs of the project. Had detailed budgeting guidance not been given, then it might not have been possible for additional funding to be released, because the required sums of money were in the millions, they needed to justify the expenditure properly.\n\nSales were much higher than expected, meaning that funds could be gained to finalise the project without the need for investments from third-party organisations.\n\nWhilst the project would probably still have been *possible* without a comprehensive budget, they would likely have struggled with gaining and managing finances much more, leading to reduced efficiency.

(2m)\n\nVariance analysis is the technique used to analyse the difference between expected units sold and actual units sold, as well as expected price per unit and actual price per unit. By calculating the differences, the business can identify whether or not they need to make changes.\n\n## What is the difference between a favourable variance and an adverse variance? (4m)\n\nA favourable variance means that the deviation is in favour of the business, so more units sold than expected, or sold at a higher unit price than expected. This would benefit the business.\n\nAn unfavourable variance is one that occurs in a way that is detrimental to the business. So maybe units are selling for less than predicted, or less are selling in total.\n\n## Explain two reasons why an adverse variance might not be a sign of poor management by the budget holder. (9m)\n\nAn adverse variance could be caused by unexpected external factors, such as political changes. If a new law is introduced that interferes with the business operations, then it may cause the business to have to pay more per unit sold, leading to higher costs and ultimately lower profits. The adverse variance here isn't something that a budget manager could likely have predicted, and isn't something that they should be blamed for. \n\nAlso, adverse variances also occur because of an issue that has occured somewhere else in the organisation, for instance somebody working in sales may have undersold a batch of units, meaning that the adverse variance was caused by their error, not the budget planners. In this case, the company needs to address the protocols in place to ensure that this kind of underselling does not occur in future.\n\n\n---\n\n# Case Study: Budgeting the Eden Project\n\n## What is meant by the term budget ?(2m)\n\nA budget describes the amount of money set aside for a certain purpose.

It allows for cash flow to be managed more intelligently.\n\n## Identifying one favourable variance from Table  17.11 (1m)\n\nSoil and plants, including nursery.\n\n## Calculate the variance between the total budgeted cost and the total total actual cost as a percentage of the budgeted cost (3m)\n\n86/74 = 116%\n\n## Explain one reason why firms find it easier to estimate revenue budgets than capital budgets (4m)\n\nCapital budgets are frequently hard to predict, as they can be caused by equipment failure.

If the current ratio is within the ideal range, then should all the active liabilities for the business come up, there would be enough assets to cover the costs and to keep the business afloat. If the business does not have a favourable current ratio, then they are at risk of going into default and possibly shutting down.\n3) A high current ratio suggests that there are wasted current assets. There is no need to have an excessive amount of current assets in the business because it reduces the investment in ventures with a return. If there is a high current ratio, then there is money not being spent that could be invested into the business. ABF plc has a high current ratio , and the ratio is increasing further. In order to maximise the businesses' long term profitability and viability, it is important that they invest these additional assets into their operations. \n   \n   It is also possible that the business needs a larger amount of current assets than standard, maybe they have lots of temporary equipment that has a high value, but by selling this equipment off to reduce their current ratio, they could put themselves in a poor situation. So it is important to analyse the use of the resources before redirecting them.\n\n4) 5.9.2018:\n\t   Current assets: 5,285\n\t   Current liabilities: 3,248\n\t   RTotal: 8,533\n\t   Asset ratio: 0.61\n\t   Liability Ratio: 0.38\n\t   **Current Ratio:** 0.61:0.38\n\t13.9.2014:\n\t\tCurrent assets: 3,626\n\t\tCurrent liabilities: 2,684\n\t\tRTotal: 6,310\n\t\tAsset ratio: 0.57\n\t\tLiability Ratio: 0.43\n\t\t**Current Ratio:** 0.57:0.43\n\n5) ABF plc has managed their liquidity adequately. They are in a positive current ratio, which means that they are not in any immediate financial risk. They have improved their liquidity over the 4 years between the two datasets, which is a positive sign for the overall health of the business. They are however not at the ideal ratio of 1.5:1, which is realistically very hard to achieve, but they could put resources towards trying to get closer to this value than they currently are. It is financially smart to ensure that their current ratio is as good as possible to ensure that the business is capable of adapting much more dynamically to changes in the environment and to unexpected charges. \n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.684382108Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/ImportanceOfQuality":{"title":"Importance of Quality","content":"\n## Measures of Quality\n\n### Tangible\n\n- reliability\n- functions and features\n- support levels and standards\n- cost of ownership (repairs etc)\n\n### Intangible\n\n- brand image\n- exclusiveness\n- market reputation\n\n## Importance of Quality\n\n- Markets are **highly** competitive\n- Customers are increasingly:\n\t- knowledgable and demanding\n\t- prepared to complain about poor quality\n\t- able to share information about poor quality via the internet\n- If a business can develop a reputation for high quality then it may be able to create an advantage over its competitors.\n\nQuality is every stage, not just the product.

This may result in many customers being unsatisfied with the product and will likely lead to a spike in returns. \n\nIt is also possible that an external factor to the production process may be causing issues, such as careless handling of the products in logistics, which could cause damage to perfectly fine units and require the business to replace them.\n\n**Other options:** New staff, problems with raw materials, faulty machinery etc\n\n\n---\n\n## Quality and the Law\n\n- Products must meet a minimum standard set out by the law.\n\nThis includes the likes of:\n\n- Satisfactory Quality\n- Fit for purpose\n- As described\n\n\n## Quality Control - detecting faulty output\n\n- The traditional way of managing quality and means a business will be checking and reviewing work that has already been done.\n\nIncludes:\n\n- Inspection\n- Testing\n- Sampling\n\n- Quality control is mainly about \"detecting\" faulty output rather than preventing it\n\n- Quality control can also be a very expensive process as there may be a large number of rejects before a problem is spotted.\n\n---\n\nYou could measure low quality by looking at:\n\n- Customer feedback/reviews\n- Customer surveys\n- Returns\n- Quality checks at the end of production\n- Mystery Shoppers\n\nFor Quality Assurance see the QA doc via search.\n\n## Benefits to improving quality\n\n- If a business improves the quality of their processes ir the products and services offered it may:\n\n    - Motivate the employees to be working with better machinery or systems\n    - reduce the cost from waste and reworking faulty goods\n    - less time wasted sorting customer complaints\n\n## Difficulties of improving quality\n\n- Once a quality assurance system has been implemented it will need to be checked regularly to make sure employees are filling in the paperwork and following new principles.\n- New quality procedures may require an entire company culture shift which will take time.\n- Can be expensive at the start especially if better machinery has been purchased.\n\n[Business](/Business)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.684382108Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/InternalAnalysisFinancials":{"title":"Financial Ratio Analysis","content":"\n## SWOT analysis\n\n- Strengths\n- Weaknesses\n- Opportunities \n- Threats\n\n\nSW → Internal\nOT → External\n\n## Financial Statements\n\n### Management accounting\n\n- The creation of financial information for use by the internal users within the business in order to predict, plan, review and control the financial performance of the business.\n\n- Management accounting data:\n\t- Revenue, cost and profit objectives\n\t- Decision trees\n\t- Investment data\n\t- Capital structure data and source of finance\n\t- Cash flow forecast and outcomes\n\t- Budget and outcomes\n\t- Break-even charts\n\t- Etc\n\n### Financial accounting\n\n- The provision of financial information to show external users the financial position of the business; it concentrates on historical data.\n\n- Financial accounting data:\n\t- Cash flow statements\n\t- Data on profitability\n\t- Capital structure\n\t- Sources of finance\n\t- Income statements\n\t- Balance sheets\n\n## Income Statements\n\n- Profit and loss accounts\n- Historical record of the income and expenditure over a period of time (typically the preceding year or quarter)\n- Sole trader, private limited company, public limited company\n- Gross profit, gross profit margin, net profit, net profit margin\n\n![[sixth/Business/Units/nd/img/Pasted image 20230509100900.png]]\n*Example income statement*\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.684382108Z","tags":["business"]},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/InterpretationOfVariances":{"title":"Interpretation of Variances","content":"\n\n- The difference between a budget and the actual result is described as a variance.

Many focus on 95% to give room for handling of issues.\n- A high level of capacity utilisation is required is a business has a high break-even output due to significant fixed costs of

It has solutions to different tasks in many different languages.\n\n\n## Translators\n\n- Source code **needs** to be translated into object code.\n- Object code is combined with other object code to create machine code before it can run.\n\t- Examples of object code could be other translated source code or standard libraries provided with languages.\n\n| **Source Code** | _Machine Code_ | _Assembly Code_ | _High Level Code_                                      |\n| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Translate**   | N/A            | Assembler       | Compiler / Interpreter                                 |\n| **Combine**     | Linker         | Linker          | Linker (usually automated) Interpreter bypasses linker |\n| **Executable**  | Machine Code   | Machine Code    | Machine Code                                           |\n\nAssembly has a 1:1 equivalence with machine code. It is the exact same, just represented with keywords rather than binary.\n\n## Compiler or Interpreter\n\n- Compiler\n\t- The source code is translated into object code\n\t- This only needs to be done once\n\t- The result is machine code that will run very quickly\n\t- No other software is needed to be supplied to the user\n- Interpreter\n\t- The source code is interpreted by a special program at run time.\n\t\t- The source code, effectively, calls upon pre-built routines in the interpreter.\n\t- This must be done every time the program is run\n\t- Interpreted programs do not execute as quickly as compiled code.\n\t- You must provide the end user with a copy of the interpreter AND your source code.\n\n## Errors\n- When writing code, we should expect a few errors\n\n- Errors fit into three classifications\n\t- Syntax Errors: the grammar of the statement is wrong\n\t- Runtime Errors: the program has received some wrong data that it cannot process\n\t- Semantic Errors (logical errors): the program gives the wrong result.\n\n## Exceptions\n- Exceptions happen when something exceptional (unexpected) happens.\n- This is often an error, although it doesn't mean the error is unexpected\n\t- The programmer can write exception handling routines to deal with these situations\n- Throwing, catching and fatal errors.\n\t- When an exception happens, we describe this as throwing an error.\n\t- Having a routine to deal with it is called catching an error.\n\t- A fatal error would be an error that is thrown but for which there is no catch routine.\n\n- When an error gets thrown:\n\t- The current process gets suspended.\n\t- The exception handling routine is called—if it exists.\n\t\t- If there is none, the program crashes.\n- The original routine is restored.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220928120809.png]]\nThe above diagram shows the flow if the exception is caught. If it is uncaught, then it will just crash.\n\n## Development Lifecycle\n\n- Initiation—what needs to happen. \n- Feasibility study—can I solve this problem? Is it affordable?\n- Analysis—what is the problem? Legal limitations?\n- Planning—how are we going to achieve the goal? What needs changing? Who is doing what?\n- Design—Creating flowcharts, pseudocode, FSMs etc.\n- Development—Writing the code, creating databases etc\n- Installation/ roll-out—Put everything into a production environment, ensure it is working.\n- Training—Make sure the people who need to use the product can use the product.\n- Maintenance—Fixing issues, ensuring performance and security are up to standard. Keeping the system ticking over.\n\nThis is not a rigid list, not everyone uses every stage, and not everybody does them in the order used here. Some people may collapse stages into larger categories.\n\nYou can go back through phases if an issue arises.\n\n[Planning is important!](sixth/CompSci/Programming/Planning)\n\n\n[Majority of programming work is found on GitHub](sixth/CompSci/Programming/ProgrammingChallenges)\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.732384256Z","tags":["compsci"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/ProgrammingChallenges":{"title":"Programming Challenges","content":"\n\nSee programming challenges from Comp Sci here: [Crispy Fiesta](https://github.com/isaluki/crispy-fiesta)\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.732384256Z","tags":["compsci"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/StateMachines":{"title":"State Machines","content":"\n## Finite State Machines\n An FSM shows the states in which a system can exist, what causes the system to move from one state to another, and what outputs or changes the transition causes.\n\nThe system must have a known (finite) number of states.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220920143733.png]]\n\nFSMs can be converted into a circuit, meaning that they can be used to control things such as traffic lights without the need for actual code.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220920145051.png]]\nStates are connected by transitions (arrows).

They are ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways.\n\nWhereas a formal language is like a formula in maths or science and programming languages. It can only be interpreted in a single way and is very rigid.\n\n\n### Algorithms\n\nTypically, an algorithm will use a formal language (or will be much closer to formal than natural). A recipe is an example of an algorithm that can be represented using natural languages, with a more formal structure. A recipe can be misinterpreted, a program cannot.\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.732384256Z","tags":["compsci"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/Subroutines":{"title":"Subroutines","content":"\nInstead of writing a huge, monolithic piece of code, you can break a program down into smaller pieces, called subroutines. These allow for increased modularity in an application. It also makes it much easier to work on a project with multiple people involved because they can each write subroutines to work together and produce a complex system quickly.\n\nIt is much easier to solve a problem by breaking it down into subroutines.\n\nAll subroutines are reusable, meaning that if you write a utility to authenticate a user, you can call the same subroutine from multiple places, keeping code tidy and reducing time-wasting.\n\nHere is an example subroutine written in Python:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(1,2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will return the literal `3`. This is because we pass the values `1` and `2` to the subroutine, which then adds them together. The answer is printed out because we save the result in a variable and then display it with the `print` command.\n\nHere is a demonstration of the program being executed:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908123946.png]]\n\nTaking this a step further, we could ask the user to pick the values to add together. We would do this using the following code:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# This could be more efficient, and will crash if we enter an invalid input.\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter num1: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter num2: \"))\n\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(num1,num2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nAnd the result looks like this when we run it:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908124522.png]]\n\n## Types of subroutine\n\n\u003e [!abstract] In terms of Python\n\u003e\n\u003e The following uses Python keywords as examples, but the same logic can be applied to any language.\n\nBecause this code uses the `return` keyword, it is a **function**.\n\nThe other type of subroutine is a **procedure**, this would not use the `return` keyword.\n\nA procedure does not return any value to the logic that called it, whereas a function does. This is the only difference between the two types.\n\nA function would typically be used where a response is needed or the status of the action needs verifying. If you do not need an answer, then a procedure may be the best choice.\n\nSubroutines are made out of the basic [building blocks](sixth/CompSci/Programming/BuildingBlocks) found here.\n\n## Task: Write a subroutine\n\nA procedure that:\n- Receive a person's name\n- Adds \"from PHHS\" to the name\n- Prints the product\n- Ends\n\n```py\ndef FromPHHS(name):\n\tprint(name+\" from PHHS\")\n```\n\nNext, a function to convert celsius to fahrenheit:\n\n```py\ndef CelToFaren(celsius):\n\tfahren = celsius * 1.8 + 32\n\treturn fahren\n```\n\n\u003e [!info] Identifiers\n\u003e\n\u003eJust like with variables, the name of a subroutine is officially called an identifier. Also - just like with variables - the identifier should be descriptive as it improves code readability.\n\nTo extend the functionality of a subroutine (or any of your code), modules are very useful.

So if it is contained within a variable - it is a value.\n\n---\n## Expression\nAn **expression** is an operation of values and/or variables that will result in a value.\n\nTypically, you get a different value output than the input - as you are performing a mathematical operation usually (and most of the time you won't  be doing a * 1 operation).\n\nExamples:\n\n- 32 * 4\n- 15 - 2\n- 43 / 7\n- 3 == 5\n- \"hello\" + \"world\"\n- 4 \u003e 2\n- \"hello\" * 4\n- input(\"What is your name? \") * 6\n- ((12 * 6) /4 ) + 8\n\nExpressions are used to modify or compare values. They may contain a function call (ie, `int(3.4) * 5` is still an expression).\n\nData Types do matter in expressions - so whilst you can multiply a string by an integer, you cannot divide a string by an integer.\n\nSo `Bob * 4` is valid and results in \"BobBobBobBob\"\n\nBut `Bob / 2` is not valid and will return an error.\n\nA division operation will **always** return a float - even if the inputs were integers.\n\n---\n## Statement\nA **statement** is any valid fragment of code.

It indicates whether there should be an odd or even number of bits turned ON (binary 1s). If the check bit does not match the rest of the word, then the data is corrupted.\n- The sender and receiver must agree to use parity checking and whether this is to be odd or even.

Bidirectional: From the processor to the memory and input-output devices.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221215105539.png]]\n\n\n### Address Bus\n- Memory is divided into several fixed segments called words.\n- The words may be sized at 16,32 or 64 bits, depending on the processor.\n- The addresses of operands are sent via the address bus.\n- The results are calculated by the processor and stored in a particular memory location, the address of this is transmitted via address bus.\n\n### Data Bus\n- A bidirectional bus consisting of 8,16,32,64 parallel lines.\n- Transmits instructions and data between the processor and the, memory and I/O devices.\n\n### Control Bus\n- A bidirectional bus that transmits timing, status signals and commands between the processor, memory and I/O devices.\n- Makes sure that data is travelling to the correct place at the correct time. \n- Different control signals are:\n\t- Clock: Synchronise the operations of the computer.\n\t- Memory Read: The contents in the specified address are copied to the data bus.\n\t- Memory Write: The contents of the bus data bus are copied to the specified address.\n\n## Registers\n\n- Program Counters: Holds the address of the next instruction to execute.\n- Current Instruction Register: Holds the current instruction being executed.\n- Memory Address Register: Holds the data address of the register from which data is read, or to which data is to be written.\n- Memory or Data Register: Temporarily stores the data being read from or written to the memory.\n- Status Register: Holds the bits that are set or cleared based on the results of an instruction.\n\n---\n\nStored program concept: Machine code instructions stored in main memory are fetched and executed serially.\n\nGeneral purpose registers are named R0-R12\n\n## Memory Unit\n\n- A memory unit consists of a number of partitions\n- Each partition consists of data and and address\n\n## Read Operation\n\n- To read the contents from any location, the registers MAR (memory address register) and MDR (memory data register) are used.\n- A read signal is sent by the processor to the memory. The contents are then copied to the MDR.\n\n## Write Operation\n\n- To write data into a particular address, the data is first written to the MDR.\n- The address is then written to the MAR.\n- A write signal is sent by the processor to the memory unit through the control bus and the location is written to with the data in the MDR.\n\n## Processor ALU \u0026 CU\n\n- The processor contains ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and CU (Control Unit).\n- The ALU is responsible for arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc and logic operations such as AND, OR, NOT etc.\n- The Accumulator (ACC) is the register that stores the result of arithmetic and logical operations performed by a processor.\n\n## Processor: CU\n\n- The control unit (CU) is responsible for controlling the memory, processor and input-output devices. \n- It contains the CIR (Current Instruction Register) and PC (Program Counter).\n- The CIR contains the current instruction carried out by the processor.\n- The PC contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next.\n- The control unit reads the instruction from the memory, decodes it and sends control signals to the memory and I/O devices.\n\n## I/O Controller\n\n- Each device has its own controller which is connected to a control bus. I/O controller is responsible for receiving the requests from the processor and sending control signals to the device specified for that operation. \n\n- it consists of:\n    - An interface to connect it to the system or I/O bus.\n    - a set of data, command and status registers/\n    - an interface \n\n## Assembly Language\n\n- Assembly is a low level programming language equivalent to machine code or binary instructions on a 1:1 basis.\n- It uses some word like structures to represent the instructions given to the CPU.\n- Mainly used in embedded systems because it is time consuming specialist work.\n- Assemblers translate it into machine code.\n\n- Different CPUs have different different machine and assembly codes.\n- Assembly operations are split into an opcode and an operand—LDR 2A\n\n- Opcodes are instructions. Ie, LDR = Load\n- Operands are locations or data values. Ie,  2A = 42 in Hexadecimal\n\n\n### Assembly Language Addressing\n\nImmediate addressing:\n- The operand is the data\n- LDR R1, #42 = Load 42 into register 1\n- Hash specifies a decimal value\n\nDirect addressing:\n- The operand is the address of the data\n- LDR R0, 103 = Load the data at memory address 103 to register 0\n- This can be a main memory address or one of the registers\n\nOther forms of addressing do exist, but are not relevant for A Level.\n\nAssembly instructions are provided in an exam, you do not need to learn them.\n\n## RISC vs CISC\n\nRISC:\n\n- complex instruction set processors have more and more of the commands at assembly level\n- they can interpret high level languages more directly\n- they run complex algorithms more effectively\n- this leads to more complex chip designs and higher energy use but simpler code conversion\n\nCISC:\n\n- reduced instruction set processors can't directly translate the high level instructions\n- this leads to more lines of code at the assembly level\n- they are more simply designed processors and run simple commands faster\n- RISC processors can use pipelining, simple commands can be run simultaneously\n\n---\n\n## Control Bus Signals\n\n- The different control signals transmitted by the control bus are:\n- Clock: Synchronise operations of the computer\n- Memory Read: The contents in the specified address is copied to the data bus\n- Memory Write: The contents of the data bus is copied to the specified address\n- Bus Request: A device requests to use the data bus, so it can perform a read/write operation\n- Bus Grant: Signal from the processor indicating that the device is granted access to use the data bus.\n- Interrupt Request: An interrupt is a signal sent by a device requesting access to the processor.\n\n### CBS questions\n\na) 9D needs reading. \n- Increment PC\n- MAR 9D\n- Bus request sent to request a read operation.\n- Control Unit approves read operation.\n- Bus Grant returned to authorize bus usage.\n- Memory Read performed to copy the contents of address 9D into the data bus.\n- Data saved to the MDR (memory data register)\n\nb) To write the data 76 to address 99, you would need to:\n- Increment PC\n- Bus request for write operation\n- Control Unit approves write operation.\n- Bus Grant returned to approve write operation\n- Memory Write to store the literal #76 in the address 99\n- Data bus moves data to address and saves it\n\n## Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle\n\n### Fetch\n- The program counter contains the location of the instruction that is to be executed next. This address is copied to the MAR.\n- The instruction is fetched from the memory and copied to the MDR.\n- Then the contents of the MDR is copied into the CIR.\n- The value in the PC is incremented by 1 and the instruction in the next memory location is processed.\n\n### Decode\n- The instructions are decoded so that it can be executed.\n\n### Execute\n\n- The processor sends appropriate control signals to the memory unit and input-output devices in the computer system according to the decoded instruction.\n\n## Registers (RECAP)\n\n**PC:** Program counter contains the allocation of the instruction which has to be fetched.\n**MAR:** Using the address bus, the contents of the PC is copied to the MAR\n**MDR:** The instruction at that particular location is copied to the MDR temporarily\n**CIR:** Stores the currently processing instruction\n\n## Interrupts\n\n- Interrupts allow the computer to carry out many tasks at the same time\n- When the interrupt is serviced, the status of the current job is saved. The contents of registers PC and CIR are saved onto the system stack.\n- Once the interrupt is serviced using the interrupt service routine, the current job is serviced according to its status when it was saved before the interrupt service.\n\n### Vectored Interrupt Mechanism\n\n- Each interrupt is associated with a vector, which points to the code associated with that interrupt\n- When an interrupt occurs, the current values of the registers are saved to a stack memory structure and the processor identifies the type of interrupt.\n- Then the processor points to the vector and processes the interrupt service routine. This technique is called vectored interrupt mechanism.\n\n### Interrupted Interrupt\n\n- Sometimes, when an interrupt is being serviced, another interrupt occurs.\n- The processor may save the status of the current interrupt processing and proceed to service the new interrupt.\n- Another methodology that can be used is priorities.  In this methodology, we prioritise the most important interrupts first.\n\n---\n## End of Topic\n\n1) What are the three types of bus and their functions? \nData bus -\u003e Transports data between components\nControl bus -\u003e Carries control signals and instructions\nAddress bus -\u003e Allows referencing of memory locations\n\n2) How are memory locations addressed? Each memory location has a unique ID which allows for it to be referenced through a memory address bus.\n3) The ALU is responsible for various arithmetic and logical functions within the processor. \n4) The control unit controls the memory and peripheral devices through control signals sent over the control bus (lots of control). It also receives interrupts over the bus.\n5) List different registers\n- CIR - Current Instruction Register\n- PC - Program Counter\n- MBR - Memory Buffer Register\n- MDR - Memory Data Register\n- MAR - Memory Address Register\n- SR - Status Register\n- ACC - Accumulator\n\n---\n\n## Processing Speed\n\n- Depends on the speed of the CPU, memory and bus speed.\n\n### CPU Performance\n- Four impacting factors are:\n\t- Cores\n\t- Clock rate\n\t- Cache size \n\t- Processor type\n\n### Cores\n\n- A CPU consists of multiple processing units. Each processing unit is known as a *core*.\n- A core consists of a processor (ALU and CU) and registers.\n- Computers may be dual, quad or higher core counts.\n- As the number of cores increases, the computer has more power to execute multiple programs at once.\n\n### Cores Linked\n\n- As more cores are used, communication channels between cores increase exponentially.\n- These communication channels drain some performance from each core, as every core must communicate with every other core.\n\n### Clock Rate\n\n- Clock rate indicates the number of instructions processed by a CPU in a second.\n- It is measured in megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz)\n- A 4GHz processor handles around 4 billion instructions a second\n- A faster CPU requires more power and produces more heat\n\n\n### Overclocking\n\n- The speed of a computer can be overridden by the BIOS,\n- Increasing the clock speed of your CPU is called over-clocking\n- There are circuitry limitations regarding the speed. If a computer is forced to work at a higher speed, more than its limit, the instructions might not get executed completely. This leads to data corruption and overheating.\n\n### Cache\n\n- Cache is a small memory part located closer to CPU when compared to RAM\n- Cache temporarirly holds the data and instructions that the CPU is likely to use more frequently\n- To reduce the access time, the control unit checks cache first before requesting any instructions from RAM or main memory.\n- Cache is located directly on the CPU chip.\n\n- Due to the presence of cache, the speed of CPU increases.\n\n### Cache Types\n\nLevel 1:\n- 8KB to 64KB\n- On the CPU chip\n- Fastest access time\n- Smallest cache in the CPU\nLevel 2:\n- Bigger than L1\n- Between CPU and RAM\n- Slightly slower than L1\nLevel 3:\n- Further from the CPU but still closer than the RAM\n- More storage than L2 cache\n\nL1 and L2 cache are dedicated to each core, however L3 cache is shared between all cores.\n\n### Cache Size\n\n- It is important to note that cache occupies only a small space compared to RAM\n- Cache is also expensive when compared to RAM.\n- L3 cache is typically around 4MB\n\n### Data Word Size\n\n- Each word has its own specific address\n- In case of read and write operation it is important for us to know the address of the memory location.\n- The larger the data word size, the more RAM you can use, the more operations you can handle at once, the larger the number of available opcodes on the instruction set etc\n- Typical sizes: 32-bit,64-bit,128-bit\n\n### Embedded Systems\n\n- Programmed during manufacturing stage\n- Users operate these using interfaces such as buttons or touch screens\n- The software cannot be modified, it is typically bult into the physical chip\n\n## Input devices\n\n### 2D Scanners\n\n- Read head moves over the page, detects light and converts dark and light patches into a digital image.\n\n### 3D Scanners\n\n- Similar to a 2D scanner, but also using lasers and building a three dimensional model of the object—creating an asset that can be used in games, movies or any other purpose.\n\n### Barcode Reader\n\n- Read by a laser\n- Light reflected back into the sensor\n- Light and dark areas can be distinguished\n- This is then used to distinguish between different products and communicate what product is being purchased to a PoS system.\n\n### QR Codes\n\n- A binary pattern encoded into an image\n- QR Codes are up to 7000 digits whereas normal barcodes can only store 30 digits\n- With Internet access, QR codes can be scanned anywhere.\n- They are widely used for advertising products on public transport in public areas.\n\n### Digital Cameras\n\n- Microprocessor automatically adjusts shutter speeds, focus the image, operate the flash, adjust the aperture etc etc\n\n\n### Microphone, Keyboard and Mouse\n\n- Not noted, basic.\n\n### Voice Recognition System\n\n- Used in security systems\n- It has software to compare the wave pattern of the sound from the user to the wave pattern stored in its memory.\n- If the two wave patterns match, then the user is identifies.\n\n- Breaks different sounds into *phonemes*.\n\n### Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)\n\n- A technology to identify and track tags attached to items such as cars, animals, bank cards etc\n- Identified using electromagnetic fields without a line of sight\n- Consists of a transponder and an antenna\n\n#### Passive tags\n\n- Powered by the energy from the RFID reader's radio waves.\n- Cheaper compared to active tags\n- Used when reader is less than one meter away\n\n#### Active tags\n- Powered by batteries and can send signals at a greater distance from the reader.\n- Used for tracking catds etc\n\n\n### Sensors\n\n- Read physical information and produce a digital output that cna be used by a computer\n\n## Output\n\n### Inkjet Printer\n\n- Sprays ink onto a page to convert a digital file to a physical document.\n\n#### Piezoelectric\n\n- A crystal at the back of the ink reservoir is given an electric charge and a vibration is created.\n- This vibration forces the ink to be ejected onto the paper.\n\n#### Thermal Bubble\n\n- Tiny resistors produce localised heat that vaporises ink.\n\n\n### Laser Printer\n\n- Uses powder instead of ink.\n- Uses static electricity to print.\n- Prints the whole page in one go.\n- Carries large print jobs out at higher speeds than inkjet.\n\n### 3D Printers\n\n- Layer plastics on a base in a specific way to result in a model being produced.\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/DataRepFundamentals":{"title":"Data Representation Fundamentals and Maths","content":"\n## Types of numbers\n\n### Natural Numbers\nWhole, integer numbers used for counting.

Multiple clients are placing orders at the same time. These orders need to update the same piece of information (such as current stock level).\n\n\n## The Solution(s)\n\n### Record Locks\n\n- Each record that needs to be updated is locked by the updating process.\n\t- A lock means that only that process can change the locked process\n- Lock all records needed for the transaction **before** any changes are made.\n\t- Downside: you may need to lock hundreds of records before you can proceed\n- Lock each record as it is updated but always process records in the same order.\n\n- Disadvantages\n\t- Deadlocks\n\t\t- Process A locks record 1\n\t\t- Process B locks record 2\n\t\t- Process A tried to lock record 2 but cannot because it is locked by Process B. Process B tried to lock record 1 but cannot because it is locked by Process A. Both processes wait for the record to become unlocked, causing the program to hang.\n\t\t\t- If a process crashes, then when should records be unlocked? Will they be unlocked?\n\n### Timestamp Ordering\n\n- Each record in the system has a timestamp that indicates the last time it was updated.\n- All changes are similarly timestamped to show when they were issued.\n- Rules to determine if the transaction can proceed:\n\t- If a change arrives that has a timestamp before the current record timestamp, it is discarded.\n\t- If a read is requested that has a timestamp before the current record timestamp, it is discarded.\n- Disadvantages\n\t- Important changes might be lost\n\t- Clocks must be effectively synchronised\n\n### Serialisation\n\n- Only allow the DBMS to process one transaction at a time.\n- Each transaction is processed in the order they arrive.\n- Disadvantages\n\t- Performance\n\t\t- If lots of transactions occur in a short time period then a long queue can build up and it may be some time before the changes are made.\n\n### Commitment Ordering\n\n- A minor tweak to serialisation.\n- Each update is given a priority.\n\t- Stock updates should happen before stock queries for example.\n- The system can also be made aware of invalid sequences of updates and programmed to avoid these.\n\t- For example, a stock check might be given a high priority. Other stock updates that have a lower priority  but that happened before the stock stock check may exist and be blocked.\n- Disadvantages\n\t- Performance\n\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/Design":{"title":"Databases: Design","content":"\n## Setting up\n\n- You need to  understand the purpose of the database\n\n- This means knowing\n    - What data it needs to store\n    - How the data is going to be used\n    - What the relationships are between different pieces of data\n\n- We start by talking to the customer to get as complete a picture as we can\n\n## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)\n\n- Once we've spoken to our customer, or even as we speak to our customer, we make an ERD.\n\n- This shows which entities the system needs to model.\n    - It also shows the relationships between these entities.\n\n**Example:** *A school has classes that are taught by a single teacher and attended by one or more students. Each class is taught in a single room. Students can study more than one subject but teachers can only teach one subject.*\n\n\u003e Identify the entities.\n \n- What is an entity is a discussion, not a given. Things that the database needs to track are entities.\n- Some entities may be physical—such as a teacher—whilst some are just concepts—such as a subject.\n\n\n**Entities:** school, classes, teacher, room, students, subject\n\nThe school may want additional entities, such as reports, registers, books, invoices etc. It simply depends upon the use case for the database and what the school wishes to track/do with the database.\n\nSome entities may not be needed. So for instance a school would not be required in this database as all data is stored solely for the school—if multiple schools needed to use this database then the school entity might make sense. So we can exclude **school** from our entity list.\n\nNext, we take **all** of the entities and think about how they are related to **all other** entities.\n\n### Naming conventions\n\nEntities should be named in a uniform way. The convention is to be consistent, and people typically name everything in the singular. \n\nSo we would store *classes* as *class* and *students* as *student*.\n\nThis does not technically matter in terms of database performance or functionality, it's just something that makes it easier for humans to understand.\n\n### Relationships\n\nThere are 3 types of relationship possible between entities.\n\n#### One-to-one\n\n- For each single item a link exists to another single item. \n- So one alarm links to one house. An alarm cannot be installed in multiple houses, and the imaginary security company only installs one alarm per house.\n\n#### One-to-many\n\n- For one single item, a link exists to multiple other items. \n- For example, a supplier may have mutliple products.\n\nHeinz is the supplier of baked beans and ketchup. However ketchup and baked beans only have 1 supplier, whilst Heinz has 2 products in this scenario.\n\n*Each product can only have 1 supplier.*\n\n#### Many-to-many\n\n- For each single instance, there are links to and from multiple other instances of a different entity.\n- A subject can be taught by many teachers, and teachers can teach many subjects.\n\n![Relationship Types](sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/img/relationshiptypes.png)\n\n\u003e [!caution]\n\u003e Avoid any relationship except one-to-many.\n\u003e It is significantly easier to work with one-to-many and it makes your database more flexible.\n\n---\n\nMany-to-many relationships are difficult to model.\n\nSo we break up the relationship and make a link entity\n\nSo instead of having a many-to-many link between *subject* and *teacher*, we have a one-to-many relationship between *teacher* and *subject teacher* and *subject* and *subject teacher*. This reduces wasted space to 0 in our model and also makes queries easier to manage.\n\nWith a one-to-one relationship, there is exactly one instance of each entity for each instance of another entity. Although this is OK and does provide the possibility to expand the system in future, it might make sense to combine the two.\n\nSo *House* and *Alarm* (with a one-to-one relationship) could be replaced with a single entity called *Alarm Installation*.\n\n\n\nNormalization is required to ensure that data is stored in the most proper way. So for any one data point, there is only one way it should be stored.\n\nIf the same type of information is stored more than once - ie, product details for an order, then this is a **repeating group**. It should NOT be stored in the same entity as the order. So you would make a new entity to store the repeating group.\n\nAn instance of the repeating group entity will be created for every new line required.\n\n\n---\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\n- Once we know what the entities are, we need to identify their attributes.\n- This means working out what information we need to store about each entity and what data type we need to store this as.\n- We would also need to consider, at this stage, what validation rules would be needed for each attribute.\n\n### Primary Key Fields\n\n- For each instance of an entity we need some way of identifying it\n\t- Each pupil needs an ID\n\t- Each car needs an ID\n\t- etc\n- The information we use to identify a single instance of the entity must be unique\n- Sometimes there exists some attribute that fulfils this requirement.\n\t- The VIN on a car for example\n- But often, and sometimes even if an attribute could be used, we want to make our own unique ID.\n\n- The ID value when seen in the entity that is identifying is called the **Primary key**.\n- When used in another entity, it is used to link two things together and is called a **Foreign key**.\n\n\n- Sometimes we can't use a single attribute to uniquely identify an instance of an entity.\n- In this case we might need to use two or more attributes.\n- This is called a **Composite Key** (sometimes a *Compound Key*).\n\n- A key can be a primary key **and** a foreign key.\n\nKeys are how we create relationships in a relational database.\n\n## Normalization\n\n- We've identified the entities and the data that we think should be stored in them.\n- Normalization is the process of ensuring that the data is stored in the most efficient way possible.\n- When we're finished, the data is said to be in Third Normal Form.\n\t- First and Second Normal form are not relevant.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Important\n\u003e\n\u003e A database is in third normal form if every attribute in every entity is dependant on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.\n\n*Reference to the key is primary or composite key.*\n\n### Third Normal Form\n\n- We make sure that each entity only has attributes that depend on the whole key.\n- Remove any repeating groups.\n- We make sure that we have no many-to-many relationships.\n- All data is atomic\n\t- Atomic meaning that no attribute contains more than one piece of information\n\nA name is not atomic because it contains at least 2 pieces of information \"FirstName\" and \"LastName\". Storing it just as \"Name\" would be possible, but would greatly complicate things later on. \n\nIt is also possible to break information into more pieces of information than necessary. For example, if your address was “23 Chester Close\"” you might try and break it down into \"23\" and \"Chester Close\". However as it is the first line of their address, it is a single piece of information. This does depend upon use case of course, because if you just want to find people living on a certain street, then you might wish to collect street names as seperate entities.\n\n## Reasons for normalization\n\n- Eliminate duplication\n\t- Make sure each piece of information is only stored once\n\t\t- Only store the customer details once\n\t\t- Don't store the same details in another table\n\t\t- Link back to the customer entity with a foreign key\n- Eliminate redundancy\n\t- Storing the same information twice but in different forms\n\t\t- Storing an engine power in horsepower and torques\n\t\t- Storing a length in meters and feet\n- Eliminate anomalies (insertion, update or delete)\n\t- If there are no duplications, we can't get anomalies\n\t\t- I have a customer's address stored twice in two entities\n\t\t- When I update this information I only update one instance\n- Eliminate inconsistencies\n\t- An inconsistency is the result of an anomaly.\n\t\t- Having had the anomaly mentioned above I now have two addresses for the same customer\n\t\t- How would I determine which one is correct?\n\n- To improve database performance\n\t- Reduce storage requirements\n\t\t- No duplication means less data\n\t- Increase operation speed (lookup, update, delete)\n\t\t- No duplication or redundancy makes operations simpler and use less resources\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","databases"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/Overview":{"title":"Databases: Overview","content":"\n## Data vs Information\n\n### Data\n\n- Values from a source where there is no context.\n    - 16.7\n    - True\n    - Baker\n\n### Information\n\n- Values given context and therefore meaning.\n    - Today's maximum temperature is 16.7 celcius\n    - Are you passing your course? true\n    - Customer's Last Name: Baker\n\nBecause of this, it would make more sense to describe a database as an \"informationbase\".\n\n\n\u003e Knowledge is power.\n\n\n\n## What is a database?\n\n- Put simply it is\n    - persistent - it's not volatile\n    - organised - we know where things are and where things go\n    - information - it has context so we can make sense of it\n\n## Why are databases used?\n\n- Provide a centralised store for all of our information.\n    - Making sure that all users can see the same data.\n- Allow fast and accurate access to the information.\n    - For analysis and reporting.\n- Allow multi-user access.\n    - From different locations and devices.\n- Keep the data accurate.\n    - Validating the inputs and only storing each piece of information once.\n- Keeping the data secure.\n    - Authenticating users and only showing them data they're allowed to see.\n\n\n---\n\n## Legalities\n\n- The law says that data must be secure and accurate\n    - Data Protection Act (DPA)\n    - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\n- We must ensure that they stay accurate, not just because the law says so. \n    - If you move house, it is important that your bank knows this.\n    - If I delete a supplier from my system, what about products that they sold us and that we sold onto our customers?\n\nResponsibility for the safety of information relies partially on the organisation to set and enforce policies, but the individual can be liable if they go against their organisation's policies. \n\nIf someone has information stored about you, then they are legally required to give it all to you upon request within a reasonable amount of time. Some organisations are exempt from this, such as the police and various security services. Information may be withheld if the usecase of the requester is suspected to be malicious, however this becomes more complex as anyone you have data on still has their rights. \n\nOrphaned data is information that has been disconnected from linked data points. So if you have a product from a supplier and you delete the supplier from your database, then the product has no supplier. This means that the product would be orphaned.\n\n\n\n## Worksheet\n\n### Farm\n\nA databse may be used on a farm to keep track of the status of various crops, equipment and balances. This data would be useful to help the farm analyse where their money comes from by identifying the most profitable crops - and then linking this to the equipment used for those crops. Later this may lead to the farm making different decisions based on how they want to operate, for instance they may not want to grow certain crops or use certain equipment if they have identified any potential issues with it. Automatic management of different stock levels (fertilisers etc) could also be enabled through the use of a database combined with automation.\n\n### Website\n\nA website may wish to track visitors to the site and store this information in a database. If, for example, the website was providing a media sharing service, then this analytical data could be used to find out what media is most popular in different regions. This could help the website target their advertising to these regions, and ensure that any local languages are supported. Additionally, it may be possible for the website to decide where to focus development efforts when they see that 70% of their traffic comes from users on mobile devices. This means it would be a good idea for them to put resources into improving their website experience on mobile form factors.\n\n### Restaurant\n\nIf a restaurant serves 60 different dishes, there will likely be dishes that are more popular than others. If every time somebody orders something it is recorded in a database, then it would be possible for the restaurant to ensure that they always have the correct ingredients avaliable to provide customers with their favourite dinner dishes on Thursdays. Additionally, it would allow the restaurant to review the performance of different dishes and remove less popular ones from their menu. Another datapoint that the restaurant could get from collecting this information is populatirty based on time and day. They could look at when the most orders are coming in and ensure that they always have enough staff on shift on a Saturday morning whilst also making sure that on a Monday morning they have a much more minimal staff, optimising both costs and customer experience.\n\n\n### The Law\n\n1) Describe the nature of content and purpose\n2) Assess the necessity and compliance measures\n3) Identify and evaluate potential risks to data subjects\n4) Identify any additional actions that could mitigate those risks\n\n### Database Management Systems\n\n- Provides additional security\n- Sharing of data and multi user transaction processing becomes possible\n\n- Allow remote access of data\n    - Enables applications and employees to work across the world\n\n- Greatly simplified bulk operations and queries\n    - Runs queries and operations much faster due to a dedicated design\n\n\n- DBMS are more complex than flat files - a standard user cannot directly interface with it.\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","databases"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/SQL":{"title":"Databases: SQL","content":"\n## What is SQL?\n\n- Structured Query Language\n\t- A fourth generation programming language\n\t\t- The programmer expresses the problem, not the solution\n\t\t- The system already knows how to solve the problem\n\t- Used to manage databases\n\t- Used to manipulate the data in databases\n\t\t- Add, edit, delete.\n\t- Can be pronounced S-Q-L or sequel.\n\n\u003e [!info] Recap - Programming Language Hierarchy\n\u003e\n\u003e **1st generation:** Binary/machine code\n\u003e \n\u003e **2nd generation:** Assembly\n\u003e \n\u003e **3rd generation:** Python/C/Java etc (most languages are here)\n\u003e \n\u003e **4th generation:** SQL, HTML\n\n4th generation languages expect you to describe a problem, and the language will deal with finding the solution to solve the problem.

Therefore, giving DDL permissions to anyone who doesn't **absolutely require** them and **completely understand** what they are doing is a **very bad idea**.\n\nDDL commands will typically need to be tested on staging environments thoroughly before being run on live/production environments.\n\n\n## Database Management Systems (DBMS)\n\n- This is the name given to the software that we use to:\n\t- Create a database\n\t- Add information to a database\n\t- Query the database\n\t- Update the database\n\t- Delete information from the database\n- Your programs send messages to and receive responses from the DBMS.\n- The DBMS interfaces directly with the data (stored on a HDD or other secondary storage device.)\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","databases"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/SQLAndPython":{"title":"SQL And Python","content":"\n## The Basics\n\n- Python is the language you use to define how to solve a problem\n- In solving the problem, it is very common to need to access a database\n- SQL is the language that we use to define the database problem that needs solving\n- Python and most other languages provide modules to allow you to issue SQL commands to a database and read the results back\n- This means having one source file with two programming languages in it (Python and SQL)\n\n- Python supports many DBMS\n\n*Some* examples include:\n\n- SQLite\n\t- Very basic, single access, limited data types.

Good if there is high repetition, but it can sometimes be inefficient.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111135354.png]]\n\nIn video files, RLE works between frames, allowing for unchanging colours to stay as they are without using additional bandwidth.\n\nThis can cause screen tearing when it isn't working properly.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111135830.png]]\n\n## Huffman coding\n- A compression technique used to reduce the number of bits that represent each letter.\n- A binary tree is used to encode letters.\n- A binary tree is a data structure made of nodes and is constructed based on a hierarchy. A parent node in a binary tree has up to 2 child nodes.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111140114.png]]\nSo to say AB in this tree, you would use:\n`1110`\n\nIn Huffman coding, the more frequently used characters require less bits to represent.\n\nAnother, more complex tree, as an example:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111140336.png]]\n\n### How to build a binary tree\n- We need the lowest number of bits for letters with a higher frequency\n- So start with the least frequent characters, and work upwards.\n- When two nodes are close together, create a root node above to link them together.\n- When following a tree down, each possible path should terminate at a valid \"leaf\".\n\n## Encryption\n\n- The process of changing data into another form or code so that only people with access to a secret key can read it. For others, the message would be unreadable.\n\n### Caesar Cypher\n- A very simple substitution cypher. Each letter of the alphabet is shifted by a certain number of characters. A shift left of 2, would make \"abc\" become \"cde\".\n- A shift of 5 on the message \"INITIATE PLAN A\" would become \"NSNYFJ UQFS F.\"\n- Easy to decrypt, as it is vulnerable to brute force attacks and frequency analysis.\n- Longer messages are easier to decode than shorter ones.\n\n### The Vernam cypher\n- The Vernam cypher uses a one-time pad or an encryption key.\n- Encryption key: its length is equal to the length of characters, or greater than that. They keys are only used once.\n- Sender and receiver meet in person to exchange the keys and destroy them after the exchange of messages.\n- The sole mathematically unbreakable code found so far: RSA, PGP etc can be broken given enough time and computing power.\n\n- Keys can also be called salts\n- Vernam cypher works with the ASCII codes of characters. Each ASCII code is taken in binary form.\n- The one-time key is also taken in binary form.\n- An XOR operation is performed between the key and the data to produce cypher text. An XOR operation is reversible, and therefore the same method can be used to decrypt the message.\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/ExamFeedback":{"title":"Exam Feedback - April 2023","content":"\n## Trace tables\n\n- Only ever move down the table never up\n- Never erase a value, if a value is changed, move down a row\n- If a loop is entered, move down a row\n- Follow the program based on the values in the trace table once relevant\n\n\u003e [!info] Feedback\n\u003e\n\u003eMostly done on test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","feedback"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/HardwareAndSoftware":{"title":"Hardware And Software","content":"## Memory\n- The space where programs and data are stored. Data in memory is accessed through instructions from the CPU.\n- Classified into primary and secondary.\n\n### Primary Memory\n- Directly accessed by the CPU, ie RAM, ROM, Cache\n\nPrimary memory types listed in order of closeness to the CPU:\n\n- Registers\n- Cache\n- RAM\n- Virtual Memory\n\nThe closer to the chip, the faster the memory, however the more expensive the memory is.\n\n### Secondary memory\n- External devices such as hard drives, SSDs, flash drives\n\n\n## Latency\n\n- Latency is the time taken by components to respond to the request.\n- To avoid short delays between the CPU's request for data and finding the data in memory some instructions and data are copied to the cache.\n\n## Random Access Memory (RAM)\n\n- Temporary memory which stores data, files and parts of the operating system\n- All data is loaded from secondary storage into RAM.\n- Is volatile.\n\n### Dynamic RAM (DRAM)\n- DRAM consists of transistors that act as switches and capacitors that hold binary data.\n- DRAM has to be constantly refreshed (every 15microseconds) to maintain capacitor charge.\n- DRAM is used for main RAM memory.\n- Is volatile\n\n### Static RAM (SRAM)\n- SRAM uses \"flip-flops\" which hold each bit of memory.\n- SRAM need not to be refreshed constantly.\n- SRAM is faster than DRAM.\n- SRAM is used in cache memory.\n- SRAM is more complex to build and therefore more expensive than DRAM.\n- Comes in smaller capacities than SRAM.\n- Non-volatile\n\n## Read-Only Memory (ROM)\n\n- Read only memory is a permanent memory that is used to store the instructions that are executed once a computer is switched ON. This set of instructions is called a boot process.\n- This is responsible for initializing the hardware and operating system soon after the power is switched ON.\n- The contents of ROM are not erased, even when the power is switched OFF.\n- The contents of ROM can only be read and cannot be changed.\n- ROM is made by interconnecting several transistors. It is an example of non-volatile memory.\n\n## Flash memory\n- A type of ROM\n- Programmed by applying a slightly larger electric current that forces an electron through a barrier.\n- Can be rewritten\n\n## Hard disk drives (HDD)\n\n- Also called magnetic disk drives, used in computers and laptops.\n- It provides high storage capacity and is cost-effective.\n- Large storage facilities also use this technology.\n- In a computer, it can store operating systems, user data and programs.\n\n- The disk is made of a magnetic surface, known as a platter\n- Digital data is stored in these magnetic platters\n- The disk can spin at around 7000 revolutions per second\n- Data can be accessed by a number of read-write heads on the surface\n\n- Moves from centre of disk to edge and back\n\n### Latency of HDD\n\n- Relatively high \n- Latency is defined as the time taken for a specific block of data to rotate around to the read-write head.\n- High latency leads to “not responding” and “please wait” messages increasing in frequency.\n\n## Solid State Drives (SSD)\n\n- The latency is reduced in SSD compared to HDD as there is no read/write head that needs to be moved.\n- Data is stored and retrieved using the electronic properties of NAND chips.\n- This type of memory is used in USB devices to transfer information from one device to another.\n- Data stored in millions of transistors within the chip.\n\n## HDD vs SSD\n\n- SSD have faster speeds but cost more\n- A combination of both can be used, with frequently needed data store on an SSD and less frequently loaded data stored on an HDD.\n\n## Optical Storage Systems\n\n- CD, DVD, Blu-ray discs use optics to store data.\n- The surface of CDs and DVDs are made of light-sensitive organic dyes or metal alloys.\n- Data is read and written using a laser light.\n- DVDs (4.7 GB) can store large amounts of data compared to CDs (800 MB).\n- Blu-ray discs use blue laser light and can hold up to 50 GB. Used to store music, movies, and games.\n- The time taken to transfer information to these devices is comparatively higher than HDD.\n\n- After data is stored, it cannot be overwritten. Some do support being overwritten, however it is very limited.\n- The clear plastic layer on the surface allows the laser light to pass through.\n- The colour changes in the dye layer when light falls on it.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/th-1967184248.jpg]]\n\n\n## Types of memory access\n\n- Memory can be accessed sequentially or directly. Different devices work in different ways.\n\n### Sequential Memory Access\n\n- Allows user to access data one by one in a sequence.\n- Sequential memory access is slower than direct memory access.\n- Eg, film reel\n\n### Direct (Random) Memory Access\n\n- Any storage location can be accessed at any moment—such as a DVD.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/th-858488670.jpg]]\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Hex":{"title":"Hex","content":"\n#### Recall: Two's Complement\n-20\n10100\n\n010100\n101011\n\n_101100_\n\n\n-32\n100000\n0100000\n1011111\n110000\n\n-20 + 16\n101100c\n\n+\n\n10000\n010000\n\n1011111\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n1\t0\t1\t*1*\t0\t*1*\t0\t\t1\t1\t\n\n1010011\n\n\n\n-39 -83\n\n39\n\n101001\n\n83\n\n101011\n\n0101001\n0101011\n\n1010110\n1010100\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| *0* | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n|  Carries: | 1 |   | 1 |   |   |   |\n\n0001010\n\n-21 + 37\n\n21\n\n010101\n\n37\n\n100101\n\n\n0010101\n0100101\n\n# Hexadecimal\n\nHex is a base 16 system, each nibble is can be represented with 1 digit.\n\nIt is easier to use for humans than basic binary.\n\nThe memory location in a computer is stated in hexadecimal form.

It is the number of pixels or dots in a unit.\n- Magazines and books have higher resolution compared to the images on computer screen.\n- An image on a website is usually 72dpi. An image in a book has a resolution of 300 or even up to 600 dpi.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017100016.png]]\n\n## Pixel Density\n- Pixel density for a screen is calculated using the following steps.\n- Calculating the pixel density of a Samsung Galaxy S10 phone which has a resolution of 1440 x 3040 pixels and a 6.1 inch display.\n\t- Add the squares of resolution sizes, 1440^2 + 3040^2 = 11315200\n\t- Take the square root of the result = 3363.81\n\t- Divide by the screen size, 3363.81 / 6.1 = 551ppi (pixels per square inch)\n\n## Estimating the size of an image file\n- Multiply the width and height of the image by the colour depth.\n- Example:\n\t- 1010 x 562px\n\t- Colour Depth = 8\n\t- 1010 x 562 x 8 = 45409060 bits\n\t- 45409060 / 8 = 567620 bytes\n\t- 567620 / 8 = 0.568 megabytes\n\n### Practice\n600 x 800 pixels\n16 bit colour\n\n 600 x 800 = 567620\n x 16 = 9081920 bits\n = 0.96 MB\n\n\n## Run Length Encoding (RLE)\n- RLE is lossless compression\n- We count the number of bits in a row that have the same value, and then store them as one entry rather than by storing each pixel individually. \n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017101124.png]]\n\n## Metadata\n“Data about data”\n\n- Some examples of metadata for an image include:\n\t- Filename, format\n\t- Dimensions resolution, and colour depth of the image\n\t- Date and place the photo was taken\n\t- Time and date when the photo was changed\n\t- Camera settings when the photo was taken\n\nNext: [Sound](sixth/CompSci/Theory/Sound)\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/CloudComputingAndWebApplication":{"title":"Cloud Computing And Web Applications","content":"\n## Client-to-server network model\n\n- Clients are computers that request information\n- Servers are computers that provide information\n- A client depends on the server for information\n\n- For example, the client-side of a web application is a web browser. The web server provides the information.\n\n### Types of servers\n\n- Web servers\n- Application servers\n- Network Attached Storage (NAS)\n- Print servers\n- Mail servers\n\n- etc\n\n## Peer-to-peer model\n\n- In a P2P network, each and every computer in a network is responsible for providing data equally.\n- Each computer can provide data requested by other computers in the network.\n- At the same time, any computer can request data from any computer.\n\n- This type of network is not suitable for systems where there is a single source of truth (ie, databases, online ticketing systems etc)\n- Due to a lack of servers, this type of network may lead to difficulty in storing backups.\n- Known best for file sharing\n\n## Cloud Computing\n\n- The use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network such as the internet is called cloud computing. \n- A webpage displays these services to a client\n\n### Traditional computing vs cloud computing\n\n#### Traditional computing\n\n- Files are stored in the hard drive of a computer and processed using the same computer.\n\n#### Cloud computing\n\n- Files are stored online and processed using services that are available online.\n\n### Pros and Cons\n\n#### Pros\n\n- More cost effective\n- More reliable\n- Can be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. \n- Web applications are updated more frequently than traditional software.\n\n#### Cons\n\n- Requires an internet connection\n- Working in online application may lead to cyber attacks\n- Documents shared in web applications may be accessed by unauthorised users.\n\n### Webpages\n\n- A webpage is a document that can be viewed in web browsers.\n\n## Back-end/server-side\n\n- A server-side script is processed on the server when a user requests information\n- The processed script returns the result to the user's request\n- Widely used in websites and apps that store a large amount of information\n- SQL, PHP, Python, Ruby, Java and many more are used as backend languages\n- The validation of data is also carried out on the server-side by comparing the data entered by the user with the existing data in the server.\n- Hackers may try to enter malicious JavaScript in the front-end.\n\nFunctions of server-side processing are:\n- Processing client's queries\n- Provides data security\n- Encryption of data\n- Updating server database\n\n### Application Programming Interface (API)\n\n- API is a set of protocols that governs how two applications interact with each other\n- Websites often embed functions such as maps, spreadsheets etc\n- Websites typically do not create these functions independently\n- Instead, an API is used to include these functionalities within a website\n- For example, Google has an API, which various websites use to include their address in the \"contact us\" menu\n- A web application that uses API from various sources is called a mashup.\n\n- API also defines the protocols that will be used in the web service.\n- An example of such a protocol is a WebSocket which creates a connection between two computers\n\t- It provides a bidirectional communication channel between client and webserver over a single line.\n\n### WebSocket protocol\n\n- Firstly, the client sends a handshake request\n- Then, the server responds with a bidirectional channel on a single socket\n- Both client and server can send messages to each other simultaneously. In HTTP, the webpage need not be refreshed. The connection closes when one of them ends it.\n\n- The packets are also accepted without the usual security checks. As a result, this protocol helps us achieve fast and real-time communication.\n- This is widely used in online gaming and instant communication.\n- When this protocol is used, fewer webservers are required, saving transmission time, bandwidth, cost of hardware and cost of mobile communication.\n\n### Thick vs thin client computing\n\n- The term thickness refers to the independent processing and storage of a client in a client-server model.\n\n#### Thick client \n\n- A thick client processes most of its data and requires little help from the server\n\n###### Pros\n\n- Operates without server connection\n- Robust and reliable\n- Used for powerful software applications\n\n##### Cons\n\n- Expensive to install as it requires highly specialised computers at the client side.\n- Software has to be installed at each client computer and maintained regularly.\n- Data is distributed, so data integrity issues may arise.\n\n#### Thin client\n\n- A thin client is highly dependent on the server for data processing and storage\n- Without a server, the functionality of a thin client will be affected\n- The thinnest client that requires a server for most of its operations will only require minimum processing power and no storage.\n- This type of client system is often referred to as a dumb terminal.\n\n\n##### Pros\n\n- Easy and inexpensive to set up\n- Easy to update and maintain the client systems\n- Data is secured at a centralised location\n\n###### Cons\n\n- Client computers are affected when a server malfunctions\n- Setting up a highly efficient server is expensive\n- Highly reliable network connections are required\n- When the number of client computers increased, the performance of this model may be affected\n\n\n### CRUD\n\n- CRUD stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete\n- CRUD explains the main functions of a database. Without the four functions denoted by CRUD, it is not possible to have a complete database.\n- It also specifies how data is obtained and presented to the user.\n\n### REST\n\n- Representational State Transfer\n- REST is a system design concept in which the HTTP request methods are used to interact with a database server through a webserver.\n- The client does not know how the data is received and processed by the database.\n- In this type of system, client and server systems can be developed independently. \n\n\n### JSON and XML\n\n- JSON and XML are methods used to format data objects transferred across servers and web applications.\n- When a user places a GET request, the values in the table are returned\n\n#### JSON\n\n- Based on objects and values, easy to read\n- Less number of lines of code generated\n- The syntax is simpler\n- Arrays are supported\n- Data is clearly defined and easier to parse\n- Due to limited number of data types, JSON is not suitable for all applications\n\n#### XML\n\n- Use markup tags to make it comparatively easier to read\n- Comparatively more lines of code\n- Complicated syntax, harder to make\n- Data is extracted from tags, harder to parse\n- Wide range of available data types\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","networking"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/DataTransmission":{"title":"Data Transmission","content":"\n\n- Technologies that allow users to transmit data from one point to another\n\n## Serial Data Transmission\n\n- Well suited for long distance communication, but the speed of the transmission is lower as there is only one channel used.\n- There is no need for data synchronisation as bits are sent in one channel.\n- USB is a common example\n\n## Parallel data transmission\n\n- Parallel transmission is faster than serial transmission as multiple channels are used.\n- Used internally within a computer\n- An internal timer synchronises the data on different channels\n- 8-64 bit data buses are used\n\n## Asynchronous data transmission\n\n- In async data transmissions, the data is sent in groups in an agreed bit pattern. Bits are combined with a start and a stop bit.\n\n\n## Synchronous data transmission\n\n- A synchronous data transmission sends data as a stream of bits.\n- The data also contains timing signals that are generated by an internal clock.\n\n\n\n## Universal Serial Bus\n\n- A USB device has four pins\n- Two pins are responsible for connecting wires, which carry the power and ground connection\n- The two other pins connect the wires that transfer data\n- Hence the cable used to connect two USB ports is a four-wire shielded cable.\n\n- USB devices are detected by a computer due to a small change in voltage from the device being connected.\n- Computer determines the specifications of the USB device\n- Computer loads the appropriate driver to communicate with the device\n\n---\n\n### Error-checking methods\n\n- When data is transmitted through a channel, it could get corrupted or changed by electric fields or dirty equipment\n- Hence, it is very important to implement error checking method sin computer technology.\n- These methods are used to detect and correct errors:\n\t- Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)\n\t- Parity Checking\n\t- Majority Voting\n\t- Checksum\n\t- Echo check\n\t- Check digits\n\n\n### Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)\n\n- In Automatic Repeat Request, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT and TIMEOUT ensure that error-free messages are received at the destination.\n- ACK is a message sent by the receiver to confirm that they have received the data correctly.\n- TIMEOUT is the time allowed to elapse before an ACK is received\n- If the ACK is not received within the TIMEOUT, the message is automatically resent.\n\n### Parity Checking\n\n- Parity checking uses a parity bit in each byte of data. This bit is allocated before transmission. \n- An even parity has an even number of bits 1s in a byte. An odd parity has an odd number of bit 1s in a byte.\n- Systems may use even or odd parity.\n- The sender and receiver make an agreement prior to the transmission about the type of parity.\n\n- To find the exact location of the bit changed, a block of data is sent. The parity is checked both horizontally and vertically. \n\n### Checksum\n\n- A value called a checksum is attached to the end of the block of data. This value can indicate transmission errors.\n- Checksum = the sum of all the digits, if the sum of all digits is less than or equal to 255\n- Else, the following algorithm is used:\n\t- Divide the sum X by 256\n\t- Round down to the nearest whole number, Y\n\t- Multiply Y by 256 and denote this number as Z\n\t- Checksum = X-Z\n\n- The sender transmits the block of data with checksum\n- When received at the receiver end, the checksum of the block of data is calculated.\n- If the calculated checksum is equal to the checksum  transmitted by sender, then there are no transmission errors\n- If both the checksums are not equal, the sender is requested to resend the data.\n\n\n### Echo check\n\n- In this the data received is sent back to the sender \n- The sender compares the two sets of data for transmission errors\n- This method is not very reliable because it cannot be decided in which transmission the data was corrupted.\n- An error-free echo check would prove that no data has changed or been corrupted.\n\n### Check digits\n\n- Check digits is another method that is used to detect errors.\n- In this method, an additional digit is added to the end of a string of numbers\n- This bit is calculated using a standard algorithm and is called a check digit\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","networking"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/Layering":{"title":"Layering","content":"\n## Concept of layering\n\n- Layering is the process of breaking a complex process into several processes or layers in a particular order.\n- Layers help to solve a complex problem by dividing into a set of simple layers.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230320095439.png]]\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230320095507.png]]\n\n- Now, a group of developers can work together to solve each layer. \n\n## Network Layers\n\n### Application Layer\n\n- This layer is responsible for ensuring that the data supplied by the sender from their application can be viewed by the receiver's application.\n- These applications allow the user to access emails, websites and perform file transfers.\n\n### Transport Layer\n\n- The data from the application layer is divided into various segments in the transport layer at the sender's side.\n- The various segments are called packets.\n- Each packet also contains a header that denotes the total number of packets, packet number and port number. \n- The port number reflects the protocol\n-  If any packets go missing during transmission, the transport layer is where a resend will be handled (TCP only).\n- Windowing happens at this point\n- TCP/UDP exist at this layer.\n\n### Internet Layer\n\n- Internet layer adds the sender's and receiver's addresses in the data packet.\n- Using the information, this layer routes the data packet from the sender to receiver.\n- A socket specifies to which device the data packet must be sent to and to what application it was sent from.\n\n### Link Layer\n\n- Link layer deals with the physical connectivity between sender and receiver.\n- The Network Interface Card (NIC) of any device is uniquely identified using its MAC address.\n- Link layer adds the MAC address of the sender and the receiver to the network address.\n- Now the data is streamed to the correct hardware device.\n- This layer is also responsible for error detection, hardware addressing, media access control and defining physical layer standards.\n\n## Encapsulation of data\n\n- Each layer of the TCP/IP stack adds information to the data. This is called encapsulation.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230320101342.png]]","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","networking"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/NetworkProtocols":{"title":"Network protocols","content":"\n- Networking protocols define the rules and conventions for communication across a network.\n- Protocols define speed of transmission, error checking, async/sync etc.\n\n## Handshaking\n\n- The protocols are established between sender and receiver before starting communication.\n- This is done via a handshake.\n- Data packets are exchanged between various routers.\n\n### TCP 3-way handshake\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230310135158.png]]\n\n## IP vs Mac address\n\n- A Mac address is provided by the NIC manufacturer and cannot be changed, but can be spoofed.\n- An IP address is typically assigned by a router, and allows for easier communication across the internet and within your local network.\n\n- IP addresses are more commonly used in networking applications.\n\n### IPs\n\n#### IPv4\n\n- 32-bit IP addresses\n- Around 4 billion possible IPs\n- 8 bits form an octet.

In a single network, 2^24 hosts can be used. In total, only 2^7 such organisations can be addressed.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230316105337.png]]\n\n## Classless Addressing\n\n- In classless addressing, an IP address has an 8-bit suffix that specifies the number of bits allocated for network ID.\n- For example, if the 8-bit suffix represents the number 14 and the remaining 18 bits represent the host ID.\n- For example, 172.45.9.3/14 is represented in binary as given. \n\n## Subnet masking\n\n- A subnet mask is used to identify the two parts of an IP address.\n- For example, a subnet mask 255.0.0.0 represents a network ID of 8 bits and a host ID of 24 bits. This is equivalent to a suffix /8 in classless addressing. (CIDR)\n- When AND operation is performed between an IP address and its subnet mask, its network ID is obtained.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230316110106.png]]\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230316110304.png]]\n\n\n## Public and private\n\n### Private\n- These addresses need not be registered on the internet registry.\n- Private addressing for internal networks saves unique IPv4 addresses that can be used for routers and web servers that connect to the internet daily.\n\n### Public\n\n- Some public IP addresses are also identified using domin names.\n- A DNS server translates the domain name to an IP address.\n\n## Static and Dynamic addressing\n\n\n### Static Addressing\n\n- Static IP addresses are assigned by the network administrator. When the device is in use, this address remains unused.\n\n### Dynamic IP Addressing\n\n- An IP addressing can be used when the device is not used.\n- The protocol responsible for this is dynamic host control protocol (DHCP)\n\n## Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP)\n\n- DHCP also provides subnet masks and other automatic configuration details. This eliminates the problem of manual configuration.\n- Takes care of frequent changes in an IP address\n- Allocates private addresses within an internal network\n\n\n- Broadcast to all DHCP servers requesting an IP\n- A DHCP server offers an IP for a particular duration\n- Broadcasts a message confirming the request for IP\n- DHCP server that offered the IP address sends an acknowledgement and assigns the DHCP client the IP address.\n\n## Port Numbers\n\n- A port number is a 16-bit number attached to the  IP address that is used to identify a process or application on a computer\n- Using this number, an application running in the client system is accessed.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/Networking/img/Pasted image 20230317121301.png]]\n\n*I am familiar with ports, so some information has been omitted.*\n\n## NAT—Network Address Translation\n\n- A network address translator provides external access to a privately addressed network as shown in the figure.\n- 1 public IP is shared between all private IPs.\n- Adds a layer of security \n- Private IP addresses are not available to external servers\n- Router tracks requests and reassigns them to the appropriate host\n- Port numbers are assigned with a specific time frame\n\n## Port Forwarding\n\n- Port forwarding is an application of NAT where port mappings are explicitly defined, allowing you to talk to services behind non-standard ports.\n\n\n## TCP/IP \n\n- TCP/IP is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices of different manufacturers on the internet.\n\n- Source -\u003e Sender of the message\n- Destination -\u003e Receiver of the message\n- Packet sequence -\u003e The order of the message in which it should be reassembled\n- Data -\u003e Contents of the message\n- Error checking -\u003e Bits to make sure that the message has been received correctly\n\n\n## User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\n- A protocol similar to TCP but operates at a faster rate\n- UDP: message is sent in the form of chunks or called datagrams\n- TCP: message is sent as segments\n- Used for gaming and video calling over the internet\n\n## HTTP\n\n### CRUD\n\nC -\u003e Create -\u003e POST\nR -\u003e Read -\u003e GET\nU -\u003e Update -\u003e PUT\nD -\u003e Delete -\u003e DELETE\n\n## Email Communications: SMTP, POP3, IMAP\n\n### SMTP\n\n- Send emails\n\n### POP3\n\n- Retrieve mail from server\n- Delete mail from server\n\n### IMAP\n\n- Retrieve message from server\n- Leave mail on the remote server\n\n\n## SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)\n\n- Remotely access a terminal on another computer through a text interface\n- SSH is used by network administrators and developers\n\n- Typically runs on port 22\n\n## FTP (File Transfer Protocol)\n\n- FTP defines the set of rules for transferring large files on the Internet\n- The files required for a website are organised on a web server using this protocol.\n- Users may have private access to upload the files.

Therefore, a network is segmented and more switches are used.\n\n### CSMA/CD\n\n- In an Ethernet network, if two data frames are transmitted at the same time, both frames may collide with each other resulting in errors\n- CSMA/CD is a technology incorporated into LANs to overcome this issue\n- In CSMA/CD the sender senses the channel before sending data frames. The data frames are only sent if the channel is sensed to be silent. \n\n- In case two senders transmit at the same time, collision occurs and the data corrupts. \n- In CSMA, the problem with the scenario is solved as the senders receive a corrupted form of data frame sent by them. \n- Then the senders wait for a random amount of time and resend the data\n- As the waiting time is different for both senders, data collision is avoided\n\n## Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)\n\n- A mechanism to detect errors in a data packet\n- Extra information is generated from the data using an algorithm such as a checksum\n- This checksum is added to the packet before transmission by the sender\n- When this packet is received by the receiver, it calculates the checksum using the same algorithm.\n\n- If the expected number is returned, there are no errors. If different numbers are returned, the packet will be resent.\n\n# Wireless Connectivity\n\n- A wireless network uses radio signals to connect devices\n\n## Radio Transmission \n\n- Radio signals are identified using their frequency\n- Wi-Fi uses 2.4GHz  and 5GHz\n- The range of this signal is up to 20 metres. This range can vary with the thickness of a wall as the signal needs to pass through it.\n\n### Wi-Fi\n\n- A computer requires a wireless network adaptor to connect to a wireless network\n- A computer a long with a network interface controller is referred to as a station.\n- All stations within a WAP share the same channel and are tuned to the frequency of a channel to receive transmissions.\n\n### 2.4GHz waveband\n\n- This waveband can be separated into different channels\n- A channel is a communication link to send and receive data\n- Many channels are adjacent to each other\n- Adjacent channels may cause interference which leads to data corruption.\n- There are typically only 4 “clear” bands on 2.4GHz\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.760385509Z","tags":["compsci","theory","networking"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/NumberBases":{"title":"Number Bases","content":"\nA computer stores data in switches, represented as 1 or 0, on or off.\n\n## Size of computer memory\n\nA Binary digit is a bit.\n\nA nibble is 4 bits.\n\nA byte is 8 bits.\n\nA byte is the smallest unit of memory in a computer system.\n\nMemory sizes were originally base 2.\n\nIn this system, the prefixes kibi-, mebi-, gibi-, tebi- are used to avoid conflicts with the base 10 system.\n\nThis is now used for representing the size of RAM modules only.\n\n1 kibibyte (kiB) = 1024 bytes\n1 mebibyte (miB) = 1024^2 bytes\n1 gibibyte (GiB)= 1024^3 bytes\n1 tebibyte (TiB) = 1024^4 bytes\n\nAfter the standarisation of base 10 representation, memory sizes are now given as base 10.\n\n1 kilobyte (kB) = 1000 bytes\n1 megabyte (MB) = 1000 kilobytes\n1 gigabyte (GB) = 1000MB\n1 terabyte (TB) = 1000GB\n1 petabyte (PB) = 1000TB\n\n## Converting denary to binary\n\nDivide the number by 2, write down the remainder.\n\nContinue dividing the quotients by 2 and write down the remainder.\n\nList all the remainders in reverse order.\n\nSo if I have 10:\n\n```\n16  8  4  2  1 \nCannot take 16 from 10\nfirst column = 0\nCan take 8 from 10\nsecond column = 1\nremaining is 2\ncannot take 2 from 4\nthird column = 0\ncan take 2 from 2 \nfourth column = 1\nnothing left, final column = 0\n```\n\nBinary number = 01010\n\n## Binary combinations\n\nA one-bit system has a one-place value.

However, a soundwave is a continuous signal, that isn't directly digital. \n\nAn ADC (Analogue Digital Converter) is required to convert a soundwave to a digital sound file. It requires thousands of samples to be taken per second.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017102136.png]]\n\nA sample is a snapshot of what sound was detected at a specific point in time. If samples are played together at a high enough rate, sound that is close to the original can be played.\n\n## Factors Impacting Audio Quality\n- Sampling Rate: Number of samples per second\n- Bit depth: Number of bits used to represent each clip\n- Bit rate: Number of bit used per second of audio\n\n## Sampling Rate\n- Number of samples taken per second\n- The higher the rate, the greater the detail of the sound\n- Unit of sampling is represented in Hz\n- Each sample represents the amplitude of the wave at a certain point in time.\n- The most common sampling rate for music is 44,100 samples per second which is 44,100Hz (44.1kHz)\n- A VOIP typically has a sampling rate of 8kHz, which is enough for a human voice to be heard quickly, but the quality is reduced to a certain extent.\n\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017102345.png]]\n\n## Frequency\n- The number of oscillations per second is called frequency\n- It is measured in Hz and controls the pitch of the sound\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017102533.png]]\n\n## Nyquist's Theorem\n- The theorem states that:\n\t- For accurate sampling, the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency in the original sound signal.\n\t- When sampling rate is less than the frequency suggested by the theorem, the recording will not be accurate to the original sound.\n\n## Bit Depth\n- Bit depth is the number of bits available for each sample\n- The higher the bit depth, the higher the quality of the audio\n- A CD has a bit depth of 16 bits, and a DVD has a bit depth of 24 bits\n- An n bit system can have 2^n different values.\n\n### PCM\n- High-quality audio files are created as pulse-code modulation (PCM)\n- WAV or AIFF are uncompressed examples\n- The pulses of the induced electrical signal in the microphone\n\n## Bit Rates\n- The amount of data sampled per second (kbps)\n- **Bit rate = sampling rate x bit depth x channels**\n- Typically, stereo is the minimum channel count (2 channels)\n\n### Audio Quality\n- A reasonable music audio must have a minimum bit rate of 128bkps.\n- The greater the bit rate, the higher the quality.\n- This is why the audio quality of a CD is higher than that of Spotify.\n- Tidal is a music streaming solution that provides the highest streaming quality over the internet.\n\n## Analogue to Digital conversion\n\n- An analogue signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.\n- A signal from a microphone is an example of an analogue signal.\n- However, a digital signal is a discrete signal that uses discontinuous data.\n\n## File size check\n- 24 bit depth\n- 2 channel - L \u0026 R\n- Sample rate 16kHz\n- 2.5 minutes long\nsample rate *  bit depth * channels \n\n24 x 16000 x 2 = 768kbps\n768000 x 150= 115200000 bits\n/ 8 = 14.4 MB\n\n## (Musical Instrument Device Interface) MIDI\n\n- A communication protocol that enables electronic musical instruments to interact with each other using information and control signals.\n- Asynchronous serial 8-bit transmission\n- MIDI file instructs device on how to produce a musical note using several commands.\n- A command is identified by its specific sequence of bits.\n- You can think of it as the musical equivalent of an `SVG` file.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221107101325.png]]\n\n### Types of bytes\n- Status bytes\n\t- Indicates instruments about the type of action to be performed\n\t- The action of 16 channels are represented in this byte\n\t- Notes are ON or OFF\n\t- Key pressure—how hard a key is pressed\n- Data bytes\n\t- Information to status bytes\n\t- Pitch byte: denotes note to be played\n\t- Velocity note: denotes the loudness of the note.\n\n- Using a MIDI file, music identical to the original can be played every time.\n- A sequence program is required so that commands can be recognised.\n- Smaller in size than MP3\n- MIDI does not contain any audio track\n- Used in web pages, ringtones etc\n- Used for creating electronic orchestras.\n\n---\n1) Bit depth of 8 bits, what value range can be represented?\n2^n = 2^8 = 256\n2) Calculate the bit rate of a 32-bit system with a sampling rate of 44,100 samples per second and 2 channels.\n32 * 44100 * 2 = 2822400 bits\n \n2822.4kbps\n\n3) What is the file size of a 4-minute song with bit rate of question 2/\n2,822,400 * 240 = 677,376,600 bits = 84.67MB\n\n---\n1) Analogue sound is converted to digital using a DAC to sample.\n2) Sound files from the internet are typically lower quality than a CD sound file, because online services tend to use lower bit rates and higher compression to reduce hosting costs and increase speed.\n3) If the bit depth is increased, then there is a greater range of sound possible.

Faster, more flexible and efficient than a GUI, but harder to use.\n\n### BIOS (basic input/output system)\n\n- A BIOS chip is present on the motherboard\n- It runs before the operating system, but typically only tests hardware and then starts the bootloader\n- Provides a usable interface (that varies in appearance and interaction style) to change basic device settings and select a boot device.\n\n- UEFI is taking over from BIOS as it can bypass some checks and is faster.\n\n## Managing the CPU\n\n- Software must be loaded into memory from secondary storage and then commands must pass through the CPU to be executed.\n\n- Program is found on the storage drive\n- Section of RAM is allocated for the program and its data\n- Program is copied from storage drive into RAM\n- Program counter is set to the memory location\n- The program is now executed\n\n## Multitasking\n\n- An OS can run multiple programs at the same time.\n- It has to anyway, as multiple daemons need to run simultaneously.\n- To do this it must copy all programs into RAM, but then only one can be processed at once.\n- CPUs are extremely fast and can swap very quickly.\n- When one process is running, there are other processes waiting to run in a queue. They will likely swap every few ticks allowing all processes to progress at a similar rate, although priority will be given to the more urgent requests.\n\n### Scheduling\n- When multiple tasks need to be done, they have to be scheduled in a queue. The operating system may choose how to schedule jobs based on:\n- length\n- time waiting to run\n- priority\n\nThe \"scheduler\" is the module that manages this process\n\n### Scheduling Algorithms\n\n**First come, first served:** FCFS works simply by processing jobs in the order they are submitted.\n\n**Shortest Job First:** SJF always executes the shortest task first.\n\n**Round Robin:** Each job is allocated a time slice, which is a limited amount of CPU time. A job can also be put on hold if a high priority interrupt occurs.\n\n**Shortest remaining time:** Whichever job will be finished first will be done next. Reducing the number of waiting jobs is one of the main benefits of this. It does need to calculate how long each job would take to finish, giving it some delays.\n\n**Multiple level feedback queues:** Processes are separated into categories based on their need for the processor. They can be moved between queues as needed.\n\n## Memory Management\n\n- Memory is shared efficiently between processes.\n- When multiple processes are being run, the OS makes sure that each process has its data and instructions stored in a different memory location.\n- Hence, processes do not interfere with each other.\n- In the case where multiple processes require the same data, shared memory locations are used.\n\n### Segmentation\nThe memory required from process X is split into two parts.\n\nThis allows you to utilize all free memory.\n\n### Paging\nAlternatively, the memory can also be split into equally sized blocks called pages.\n\nThe information of which page is allocated to which process is maintained in a table.\n\n## Virtual memory\n- When too many processes are running and the RAM capacity is not enough, then a section of secondary storage drive is allocated for storing temporary data. This is called a swap file.\n- RAM is selected to be transferred to SWAP if it is not currently in use, to try and reduce friction and the frequency of reads/writes to the disk.\n\nUsing a swap file can be called **paging**.\n\n## Control of input-output devices\n\nThe peripheral devices are controlled using *protocols* and *device drivers*.\n\n### Protocols\n- Peripheral devices connected to the computer and programmed with machine code.\n- This describes the way that data is to be transferred between the device and the printer.\n\n### Device drivers\n\n- A device driver manages the connection with a peripheral device.\n- Handles the different requests between a computer and a device.\n- Defines the process to store outgoing data and incoming messages.\n\n- When a device is idle for more than a specific amount of time, a driver may put the device into sleep mode, to conserve power.\n- An OS comes equipped with various generic drivers, but some devices require the installation of specialized drivers.\n- A single driver is enough to control multiple peripherals.\n\t- Processes do not interfere in this case because the connection information for each device is isolated.\n\n## File Management Systems\n\n- To retrieve data from the file, an OS needs to know:\n\t- the organization structure\n\t- the amount of data needed in a structure\n\t- the protocol needed to communicate with the file system\n\n## Interrupts\n- Interrupts are signals sent from a device or application to the processor.\n- The processor will temporarily stop its current process and will service the interrupt signal.\n\n## Buffers\n\n- Hardware devices operate at a much lower speed compared to that of a processor\n- If the processor is sending data to an output device, it needs to wait for the hardware.\n- Buffers are temporary memory areas, which hold the data for the output hardware.\n\nBuffers and interrupts are used in conjunction.\n\n## Maintenance utilities: Disk defragmentation\n\n- When small files are deleted in, small parts of all clusters are free for usage. \n- If a large file needs to be stored, this file is fragmented into smaller parts and can then be stored in many small clusters.\n- When the large file is accessed, the read write head must move around lots, slowing the operation time.\n- Disk defragmentation allows for the rearrangement of data, placing all related data close to each other.\n\n## Types of OS\n\n**Distributed operating system:** Offers parallel processing system by sharing the load over multiple servers that are interlinked.\nA job is divided into simple tasks and each task is sent out over the network for the worker nodes to complete.\n\n**Multi-tasking system:** Are used in laptops and personal computers, where multiple processes run simultaneously.\nThe processor rapidly switches between processes, so it appears that multiple tasks are being completed simultaneously.\n\n**Multi-user multi-tasking system:** Based on time-sharing and implements efficient processor scheduling algorithms to divide the time between multiple users. In this system, numerous users are connected to one mainframe.\n\n**Embedded operating systems:** Are designed to perform a single task. Very limited resources. No permanent storage is provided. Accepts inputs from sensors and sends output to control devices.\n\nExamples include (certain): microwaves, missiles, automatic lights/doors, heating systems, many industrial systems.\n\n**Real time operating systems:** Mission critical systems that must be highly reliable, as their failure may have an impact on human lives. Meant to be fault tolerant with redundancy and fail safes.\n\nExamples include: ECGs, ATC, Nuclear reactors, elements of mobile phones, satellites. \n\nRTOS tend to duplicate critical infrastructure to allow for a backup to take over in the event of an emergency.\n\n**OS for mobile and handheld devices:** User interface, hardware operations and radio. \n\nEffectively two systems, one is real time and the other is mainly an interface.\n\n## Virtual Machines\n\n- A dedicated machine houses multiple guest operating systems from a hypervisor.\n- Core functionality is provided by the host operating system.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221125142347.png]]\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-05-23T09:12:21.776386225Z","tags":["compsci","theory"]},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/TwosComplement":{"title":"Two's Complement","content":"\n\nTwo's complement is a system that allows a binary number to be reversibly converted into a number with an equivalent value but negative.\n\n## The process\n\n1) Find the positive binary value for the negative number you are looking to represent.\n2) Add a leading `0` to the front of the number to show it is positive.\n3) Invert each bit in the number\n4) Add 1 to the number\n\n**Example:**\n\nDenary number: 10 \nBinary Equivalent: 1010\n\n01010\n\n10101\n\n10101\n\n*Result:* 10110\n\n## Python representation\nA fairly rudimentary representation of this algorithmically is as follows.

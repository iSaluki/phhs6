Their tails are made from fatty acids, but not always the same. A straight tail is made of saturated fatty acids and a tail with a kink in it (caused by a C=C double bond) is an unsaturated fatty acid.\n\nThe purpose of  a kinked tail is increased membrane stability. It separates phospholipids out and prevents them from becoming too tightly packed.\n\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/Pasted image 20221019120603.png]]\n\nCholesterol fits in with the phospholipids and helps to regulate the fluidity of the membrane. It does this by increasing fluidity at low temperatures by keeping the phospholipids apart and preventing a cease in motion. At higher temperatures, they have the opposite effect and reduce the fluidity of the membrane by holding the phospholipids in place and stopping them from moving too much.\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.563778546Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/CellTheory":{"title":"Cell Theory","content":"\nCell theory is the basic foundation on which our understanding of cells is built.\n\n## The discovery of cell theory over time\n\n**Robert Hooke** - 1665\n\n- cork cells\n- \"tiny boxes\"\n\n**Anton van Leeuwenhoek** - 1673\n\n- \"Animacules\", later called bacteria\n\n**Robert Brown** - 1833\n\n- Discovered the [nucleus](sixth/Biology/Cells/Organelles#nucleus) in plant cells\n\n**Matthias Schleiden** - 1838\n\n- Every plant is made of cells\n\n**Theodor Schwann** - 1839\n\n- Every animal is made of cells\n\n**Albrecht von Roelliker** - 1840\n\n- Sperm + Egg are cells - life comes from cells.\n\n**Carl Heinrich Braun** - 1845\n\n- Reworks theory, names cells \"the basic unit of life\"\n\n**Rudolf Virchow** - 1855\n\n- Cells come from other cells\n\n\n## Modern cell theory\n\n- The cell contains hereditary information (DNA) which is passed on from cell to cell during division.\n- All cells are basically the same in terms of chemical composition and metabolic activities.\n- All basic chemical and physiological functions are carried out inside cells.

The distinguishing factor between rough and smooth ER is that rough ER is coated with ribosomes.\n\nrER is the cells internal transport system and creates channels that enable the transport of substances from one section of the cell to another. The rER provides a large surface area for ribosomes to attach. The ribosomes assemble proteins from amino acids , these proteins are then absorbed through the membrane and are transported by the rER to the Golgi Apparatus for modification and packaging. \n\n## Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (sER/Smooth ER)\nLike the rER, this is a system of membrances within the cell that contain fluid-filled cavities that link to the nuclear envelope. It DOES NOT have ribosomes on its surface.\n\nsER contains enzymes that catalyse reactions involved with the metabolism of lipids. This includes: \n\n- synthesis of cholesterol\n- synthesis of lipids/phospholids needed by the cell\n- synthesis of steroid hormones\n\nIt is involved with the absorption, synthesis and transport of lipids from the gut.\n\n## Golgi Apparatus\nThis consist of a stack of membrane bound flattened sacs. Secretory vesicles bring materials to  and from the Golgi. \n\nProteins are modified here. Examples include:\n\n- adding sugar molecules to make glycoproteins\n- adding lipid molecules to make lipoproteins\n- folding proteins into their 3D shape\n\nThese proteins are then packaged into vesicles that are pinched off and then:\n\n- stored in the cell\n- moved to the plasma membrane, either to be incorporated into the plasma membrane or to be exported out of the cell.\n\n## Mitochondria\n\nThese are usually spherical, rod-shaped or branched structures and are typically 2-5Œºm long. They are enclosed in two membranes with a fluid-filled space between them. The inner membrane is highly folded into cristae. The inner-most section of the mitochondria is a fluid-filled matrix.\n\nMitochondria are the site of ATP production during aerobic respiration. They are also self-replicating, so more can be made to meet energy denand if the cell requires it. They are abundant in cells where any form of metabolic activity takes place. This includes cells in your liver and synapses.\n\n## Vacuole\nThe vacuole is surrounded by a membrane called the tonoplast and contains fluid. \n\nOnly plant cells have a large permanent vacuole. They are filled with water and various solutes to maintain the stability of the cell - as when they are full they exert force on the cell wall, causes the cell to become turgid. If all the plant cells are turgid, this helps to support non-woody plants.\n\n## Lysosomes\nThese are small bags formed from the Golgi apparatus. Each is enclosed within a single membrane. They contain powerful hydrolytic (digestive) enzymes. They are abundant in immune cells such as phagocytes, neutrophils and macrophages that can ingest and digest invading bacteria. \n\nLysosomes keep the dangerous enzymes seperate from the rest of the cell, preventing damage to organelles. Lysosomes can engulf dead cell organelles and foreign matter and return digested components for reuse. \n\n## Cilia and undulipodia\nThese are protrusions from the cell and are surrounded by the cell surface membrane. Each contains microtubules (see Cytoskeleton for more details). They are formed from centrioles.\n\nThe epitheal cells lining your airways have many hundreds of cilia that beat and move the band of mucus. Nearly all cell types in the body have one cilium that acts as an antenna. It contains receptors and allows cells to detect signals about their immediate environment. The only human cell to have an undulipodium (a lot of cillium) is a spermatozoon. The unulipodium allows the spermatozoon to move.\n\n## Ribosomes\nSmall, spherical and about 20nm in diameter they are constructed from ribosomal RNA. They are made in the nucleolus from two different subunits which pass through the nucelar envelope into the cell cytoplasm and then combine. Some remain free in the cytoplasm and some attach to the rER.\n\nRibosomes bound to the exterior of the rER are mainly for synthesising proteins that will be exported out of the cell. Ribosomes that are free in the cytoplasm - either singularly or in a cluster - are primarily a site for synthesising proteins that will be used in the cell. \n\n## Centrioles\nThe centrioles consist of two bundles of microtubles at right angles to each other. The microtubules are made of tublin protein subunits, and are arranged to form a cylinder.\n\nBefore a cell divides, the spindle, made of threads of tubulin, forms from the centrioles. Chromosomes attach to the middle part of the spindle and motor proteins walk along the tubin threads, pulling the chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell. Centrioles are involved in the formation of cilia and undulipodia:\n\n- Before the cilia form, the centrioles multiply and line up beneath the cell surface membrane.\n- Microtubules then sprout outwards from each centriole, forming a cilium or undulipodium.\n\nCentrioles are usually absent from unicellular green algae.\n\n## Cytoskeleton\nA network of protein structures within the cytoplasm. It consists of:\n\n- rod-like microfilaments made of subunits of the protein actin; they are polymers of actin and each microfilament is about 7nm in diameter.\n- intermmediate filaments about 10nm in diameter.\n- straight, cylindrical microtubules, made of protein subunits called tubulin, about 18-30nm in diameter. \n- The **cytoskeletal motor proteins**, myosins, kinesins and dyeins, are molecular motors. They are also enzymes and have a site that binds to and allows hydrolysis of ATP as their energy source.\n\nThe protein microfilaments within the cytoplasm give support and mechanical strength, keep the cell's shape stable and allow cell movement. They also:\n\n- form the spindle before cell division\n- form a track for motor proteins to walk along\n- make up the cilia, undulipodia and centrioles\n\nAnd intermediate filaments:\n\n- anchor the nucleus to the cytoplasm\n- extend between cells in certain tissues, enabling cell-cell signalling.\n\n## Cellulose cell wall\nThe cell wall of plants is outside the plasma membrane and is constructed from a bundle of cellulose fibres.\n\nThe cell wall is strong and and can prevent plant cells from bursting when turgid. The cell wall:\n\n- provides strength\n- maintain cell shape\n- contribute to strength and support of the whole plant\n- are permeable and allow solutions to pass through\n\nFungi have cell walls that contain chitin, not cellulose.\n\n## Chloroplasts\nThese are large organelles, 4-10¬µm long. They are only present in plants and some protoctists. They are surrounded by a double membrane or envelope. The inner membrane is continuous with flattened membrane sacs called thylakoids. The fluid-filled matrix is called the stroma.\n\nChloroplasts are the site of photosynthesis\nThe first stage of photosynthesis is when light energy is trapped by chlorophyll and used to make ATP. This occurs in the grana. Water is also split to provide hydrogen ions.\nThe second stage when hydrogen reduces carbon dioxide, using energy from ATP to make carbohydrates, occurs in the stroma. \n\nChloroplasts are abundant in leaf cells, particularly the pallisade mesophyll layer.\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.563778546Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/OrganellesWorkTogether":{"title":"How organelles work together","content":"**Exocytosis** is the process of exporting materials from the cell.\n\nAn example process of how organelles in a cell would work together to produce insulin would be:\n\n1) Genes are in DNA\n2) They are transcribed to mRNA\n3) The mRNA leaves the nuclear envelope via nuclear pores\n4) Ribosomes are made in the nucleolus\n5) Ribosomes translate the mRNA into a protein, which passes through the rough endoplasmic reticulum\n6) Vesicles containing insulin pass via the Golgi Body\n7) In the Gologi, the insulin is packaged and modified to be ready for use in the body\n8) Vesicles pinched off from Golgi pass to plasma membrane.\n9) Vesicles and the plasma membrane fuse and excrete insulin into the cell's surroundings via exocytosis.\n![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/Pasted image 20221019104936.png]]\n\n\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.563778546Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/PlantCells":{"title":"Plant Cells","content":"\nSee Chloroplasts, Vacuole and Cell Wall from [Organelles](sixth/Biology/Cells/Organelles)\n\nCells are typically viewed under [Light Microscopes](sixth/Biology/Cells/UsingALightMicroscope)\n\n[Biology](/Biology)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.563778546Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Biology/Cells/ProkaryoticCells":{"title":"Prokaryotic Cells","content":"![[sixth/Biology/Cells/img/Pasted image 20221019105229.png]]\n\n\n| **Feature**               | **Prokaryotic**        | **Eukaryotic**                                                     |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Nucleus               | Not present        | Present                                                        |\n| DNA                   | Circular           | Nucleus (linear)                                               |\n| DNA Organisation      | Proteins fold      | Chromosomes                                                    |\n| Extra chroma DNA      | Plasmid            | Only present in certain organelles (chloroplast, mitochondria) |\n| Organelles            | Non-membrane bound | Membrane Bound                                                 |\n| Cell Wall             | Present            | Present in some cases                                          |\n| Ribosomes             | Smaller            | Larger                                                         |\n| Cytoskeleton          | Present            | Present                                                        |\n| Reproduction          | Binary Fission     | (a)sexual                                                      |\n| Cell Type             | Unicellular        | Multi-cellular                                                 |\n| Cell Surface-Membrane | Present            | Present                                                        |\n\n\n## Endosymbiosis\n\nEndosymbiosis is the theory that a larger cell engulfed bacteria with energy producing capabilities‚Äîeventually becoming chloroplasts and mitochondria.\n\nEvidence includes mitochondria and chloroplasts dividing like bacteria;

Whereas objectives are smaller targets to help reach the aim. A business may have several different objectives to reach a single aim.\n\n#### Why do businesses have aims and objectives?\nThis gives them a purpose and a target to work towards.\n\n#### Describe what financial aims are\nIncreasing sales, revenue or sales. Anything related to directly increasing cashflow.\n\n**Survival**: Common aim for new businesses, simply focuses on keeping things going while they get started.\n\n**Profit**: Simply looking to earn more revenue than the sum of their costs. Increasing profit would allow greater wealth to the the business.\n\n**Sales**: To aim to sell a certain amount of a product, gives employees a common goal.\n\n**Market share**: To increase market share by a set percentage over the course of a year.\n\n**Security**: The entrepreneur being able to withdraw enough to be financially stable.\n\nMany financial objectives require attention to be paid to [Pricing](sixth/Business/Units/fh/ProfitMeasurement)\n\n#### Explain non-financial aims\n\n- Not usually linked to monetary success\n- Might be a solution to a social issue\n- Frequently personal to the founder(s)\n\n**Social**: Aims committing to act ethically. \n\n**Satisfaction**: The aim of turning a passion or a hobby into a business can often be a common start-up aim. \n\n**Challenge**: The challenge of starting something from scratch. Aiming to succeed on your own \u0026 with your own terms.\n\n**Control**: Having control over decisions made, your working pattern and the business direction.\n\n#### Suggest whether you believe non-financial aims are necessary for a profit-making business.\n\nYes, when people are going to give money to a business, they are likely to choose the most ethical option if it is financially viable to them. Therefore, businesses that have non-financial aims will be more inviting to new customers.\n\n#### Do you believe Lush has benefitted from having clear non-financial aims?\nYes, people knowing that no animal testing has occured makes them feel more comfortable when buying products from Lush. Things like this become a selling point and good publicity.\n\n#### Explain the reasons why businesses aims and objectives differ\n\nDifferent markets will have different problems and audiences, looking for different things. And as a business grows, it will need to update it's aims and objectives to remain competitive. It does not make sense for LEGO to aim to reduce animal testing - because they don't test on animals. Lush however has benefitted from that.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/BusinessOrganisation":{"title":"Forms of Business Organisation","content":"\n## Worksheet\nShareholder -\u003e  Someone who invests capital in exchange for a part ownership in the company\n\nMutual -\u003e A business jointly owned by all of its members and existing for the benefit of its members rather than making a profit\n\nUnincorporated -\u003e A business which is not registered with companies house.\n\nMarket Capitalization -\u003e The current value of a company calculated by share price x number of shares issued.\n\nPrivate Limited Company -\u003e A business owned by shareholders which cannot sell shares on the stock market.\n\nDividend -\u003e A share of profits allocated to shareholders\n\n- Charity\n- Unlimited\n- Public\n- Stock Exchange\n\n= CUPS\n\nIn the private sector, there are businesses owned by private individuals. These include sole traders, partnerships and private and public limited companies. Companies are incorporated meaning that they become a separate legal entity from the owners, can sue and be sued in law and the owners of shares have limited liability meaning they can only lose the amount they invested in the business.

Reduces profit.\n\nShare prices are determined by what people think the value of the business is. So a profit warning equals reduced dividend payments and business stability - therefore lower business value.\n\n1) If you start a business without limited liability, and you make a mistake, then you have no protection against anything that happens. You could end up in debt and with your personal assets at risk. Limited liability is a simple way to separate yourself from your business and create that legal barrier between the two entities.\n3) A private limited company and a public limited company are similar in many ways. However, they start to differ at the point where a plc has shares floated on the stock market, whereas a private limited company requires shareholders to be invited. A public company has additional requirements when it comes to publishing accounts and handling additional paperwork (although a private company most definitely still has paperwork). Public limited companies are much more visible to the public, and news outlets will report on their profit filings and activities much more closely. This means that a public limited company will have to be much more careful about their activities than a private one.\n4) A private limited company does not need to publish its accounts, whereas a public limited company does. This is an advantage to setting up as a private ltd, because it means that your financial data is more secure. You will be able to protect information about your cash flow from the public, meaning that it will have a minimal impact on your business. This also enables a business to be more effective at competing with other businesses in the same market, because they will not be sharing their performance information - meaning that they have more room to outwit their competitors.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyLush":{"title":"Case Study: Lush Cosmetics","content":"\n## What is meant by the term \"target market\"? (2m)\n\nThe target market is the selection of people that the business wishes to sell their products to. They try to tailor their offerings to that demographic.\n\n## State two examples of behavioural segmentation included in the article (2m)\n\n- Celebrity purchases are noted on the website, so people who like to follow celebrities will be more likely to buy from Lush.\n- They also focus heavily on freshness and authenticity of their products, meaning that people who look for quality will be more attracted to their store.\n\n## Analyse two reasons why Lush introduces new products every three months. (9m)\n\nCustomers come to Lush because their products are *fresh*, if they offered the same products constantly then the range would become stale. This would psychologically impact the customers, making them feel that Lush wasn't being fully fresh. By using fresh ingredients and changing their range up frequently, they can counter this.\n\nAlso, fresh ingredients means that products have a short shelf life otherwise they would risk damaging their reputation. This would result in them having to have a short production chain and a quick product turnover in their stores. Therefore, changing their actual products helps to keep things fresh without having much of an impact on their production.\n\n## Analyse two reasons why Lush might have decided to open its own shops when it re-launched the business in 1994? (9m)\n\nLush is ‚Äúiconic‚Äù, their stores are unlike any others. You can smell their stores from a distance, which makes them noticeable. If Lush sold their products in other company's stores, such as a supermarket, they would not be able to utilize such a marketing method. Also, people tend to consider the ethics of the store they are in more that the ethics of the company producing the product that they are buying. By running their own stores, Lush can take their core values such as freshness and reinforce them by designing their stores around their business.\n\nAlso, running their own shops would provide them with greater control over every aspect of their business. When they were selling through The Body shop, they were completely dependent on The Body Shop for all sales. If The Body Shop decided to stop stocking their products, they wouldn't have anywhere to turn. However, if running their own stores they would have greater control. Nobody would be able to cut them out of their own business.\n\n\n---\n## Lush uses market segmentation in its planning. ¬†Evaluate the usefulness of market segmentation in segmentation in enabling Lush to make large profits. (16 marks)\n\nLush utilizes market segmentation to help them focus their product development efforts on the correct target audience. By splitting the market in which they operate into segments, they can identify the people who are most likely to buy their products and ensure that they are meeting all the requirements of these customers. In this sense, the use of market segmentation is a good thing for Lush. However, when they focus solely on certain market segments they may alienate some of their customers. \n\nHowever, the risk that some customers will be excluded may be a worthwhile risk for Lush as they will be able to ensure that they stay focused on their core audience, which will allow them to retain their main customer base and provide a higher quality service to their consumers.\n\nLush achieves high profits through their market segmentation planning by finding quality selling points, such as fresh and natural ingredients, which they then use to make their high markup a reasonable purchase for their target market, which consists of people who are willing to spend more to get a product that ticks these boxes. Because Lush is operating in a fairly niche market, they don't have  a huge amount of competition either, which allows for them to take more risks when it comes to new products, and allows them to continue growing their market share.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyMiyagiMotors":{"title":"Case Study: Miyagi Motors","content":"## Prep\n### Demographic\n- 45 year old\n- ¬£65000\n- Environmentally conscious\n- meet consumer needs\n- target advertising\n\n## Analyse the reasons why Miyagi Motors need to find out the main consumer demographic for the Loris electric car (9 marks)\n\nKnowing the consumer demographic allows a company like Miyagi Motors to know who is buying their existing products, and therefore how they can ensure that upcoming products meet the requirements and wants of their market. If they produce a car that does not meet the needs of their customers, then they will not sell many and will suffer bad PR as well. However, if they do correctly factor in the main demographic for their products then they will be able to increase sales and gain good publicity‚Äîa win-win for the business and its clients.\n\nSomething that would be vital to consider when reviewing the main consumer demographic is the financial situation of the individuals. So as the average income of their consumers is around ¬£65,000/annum they will be able to spend more money than the average person, however they are still unlikely to have the target price of ¬£24,000 lying around. This would be a cost that could be offset when the customer considers the reduction in fuel costs after the purchase, and any other features Miyagi includes to improve the perceived value of the vehicle.\n\n## To what extent is consumer income the main external factor affecting demand for the Loris electric car? (16 marks)\n\nWhilst the income of the consumer is a large factor impacting whether they would look to buy a Loris, there are other factors that could have a greater influence. An example of this would be savings‚Äîas if someone had a very large sum of money in savings, but a low salary, they may still buy the Loris.\n\nIt is worth considering wider, more general economic factors as well, such as interest rates. Many people will not buy something that costs ¬£24,000 out of pocket, so they will need to borrow money from a bank. High interest rates will increase the long-term cost of borrowing money, and will reduce the probability of someone spending their money on a non-essential item like a nice car. Even if somebody does have a high enough income to afford a new car‚Äîthey may not wish to do so if they have concerns over the security of their job or the future of the economy.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyNewFrontiersTravel":{"title":"Case Study: New Frontiers Travel launch new pick n mix service aimed at rejuvenating the package holiday market","content":"\n1) New Frontiers Travel have not made any changes to their offerings for a while, however the market in which the exist has evolved significantly. With the rise of the internet new businesses have opened up to provide customers with more convenience and flexibility than what New Frontiers can offer. With increased internet access and usage potential customers have been increasingly looking for more competitive options or booking their holidays themselves, because the people offering travel and accommodation have also moved onto the internet. For a company like New Frontiers, this means that their business model is not going to hold up as it is, and they need to make modifications to their strategy to adapt to this new business landscape. \nThe introduction of their website, NewFrontiers.com, means that they can offer their new, refocused packages to customers in a format that people will be more likely to engage with.

This makes them vulnerable to the impacts of having unlimited liability, as William Timpson and any other shareholders could be liable for any damages or debts that the company becomes involved in. Because of this, it makes logical sense for the business to move towards something with limited liability. This basic change in business form, whilst it would come with a few negative side effects, immediately protects the owners from a lot of risk. A private limited company would enable the company to fairly seamlessly transition without having to make too many adjustments to the functional structure of the organisation. Another option that might be viable for a company such as Timpson is a public limited company. This business form would bring increased scrutiny over the company, and would allow anybody to buy into the business‚Äîgood for cashflow, not so great for control. \n\tSo whilst a sole trader isn't a completely unviable business form, it is definitely not a great idea. A private limited company is probably the best match for the business, as William Timpson said that he ‚Äúwould hate ‚Ä¶ having shareholders telling me what to do‚Äù, and a private limited company brings protection without letting anybody become a shareholder.\n\tA sole trader would have been a good place to start, as it is easy to set up, there is a low level of complexity and the assets at risk are fairly unlikely to be lost if it is a small business. Absolute control is given to the business owner.\n\n2) Factors impacting a plc's share price:\n- performance of similar businesses\n- overall economic status\n- profit warnings\n- accounts\n- recent business decisions\n- rumours (ie, layoffs)\n- whether or not the business will become obsolete in future\n- sustainability\n- public opinion\n\n3) When deciding whether or not to remain a private company, Timpson would have considered a wide range of different factors. These would have included the likes of financial stability, as a private company would be much more responsible for financing itself, whereas a public company would have the freedom to raise finance via the sale of shares. Because Timpson wants the company to remain private to give him more freedom over the decision-making aspect, he would have to find a way to justify the financial side of this move, as anybody who wanted to transition to a public company would likely use the financial difference as an argument point. Another important factor in this decision would be the risk of a hostile takeover. As a public company, the business would be very vulnerable as a low share price could leave them open to be bought out by another organisation. This would likely conflict with the interests of Timpson, because he likes retaining control over the business. A loss of control may end up being a worthwhile sacrifice, though, as a public company comes with advantages too. These include the obvious, like being able to sell shares easily, but also less clear benefits like greater public presence. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyThatsEntertainment":{"title":"Case Study: That's Entertainment","content":"\n\n## Assess the value of the market research carried out by James (9 marks)\n\nJames carried out several forms of market research, which is good because it distributes the sources and helps to verify the authenticity of the data that he gathers. He performed secondary research using a UK-based website. This is good because the data is easily accessible and can be accessed in large quantities. He found that the average cost of a child's entertainer would be about ¬£135‚Äîacross the UK.\n\nThis information is useful for approximations, however it should not be taken as hard facts. Because of the nature of a website, the data may be outdated, leading to false expectations, and it is also very possible that it doesn't reflect the demographic of James's local area. For instance, because his local area had ‚Äúhigh unemployment‚Äù, people may be looking to reduce costs by cutting out unessential spending, such as a child's entertainer.\n\nLuckily, he decided to reinforce his findings with primary research, in the form of a questionnaire that he handed out to parents at the local school. With this, he managed to discover that‚Äîbased on 20 returned surveys‚Äî56% of parents had an interest in a child's entertainer, and he found that they were prioritizing quality over price. This suggests that there are good grounds for James to enter the market, especially as only 1 of the local entertainers offers a children's magic show.\n\n\n## To what extent do you agree that the market research James carried out will ensure the success of his new business? (16 marks)\n\nMarket research is unable to ensure anything, it should never be treated as a hard-set market setup, because it is based on samples of sections of a market‚Äîit doesn't represent everyone. James got 20 questionnaire responses, and has extrapolated to a larger population from this data. This is an assumption, not a guarantee. It is therefore possible that the people who returned surveys are a minority and that James's business might not get enough traction to to become profitable.\n\nHis secondary market research can act as a reinforcement of the primary research he performed, as parallels can be drawn between the results. For instance, it is possible to see that opinions found on Netmums can be related to those shared by local parents. This can be used to make the educated suggestion that approximately 50% of parents would consider paying for a children's entertainer.\n\nHe has not taken factors such as population size into account. Because if he is only planning on operating in a small region, then the existing entertainers in the region may already saturate the market, and their experience and loyalty may be able to allow them to outcompete James. If this is the case then it may be true that customers have a demand, but the supply would already be provided. He could have improved his research by asking customers whether they had found a child entertainer, and whether that child entertainer had provided everything that they wanted. This would have enabled James to identify gaps in the market and increase his probability of success in a situation where the market is already competitive. \n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/DifferentFormsOfBusiness":{"title":"Understanding Different Business Forms","content":"\nBusiness forms typically depend upon some of the following factors:\n\n- Business Objectives\n- Stakeholders\n- Shares \u0026 Shareholders\n- Organisational structure\n\n## Business Form Mapping\nThe private sector is any business that is owned by partners, owners or shareholders.\n\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220915094507.png]]\n\n**Incorporated:** Private Limited Companies and Public Limited Companies\n\n**Unincorporated:** Sole Trader and Partnership\n\n## Business Research: Public Limited Companies\n\nA plc tends to be a fairly established business, as it costs ¬£50,000 to set up (at least) and therefore it is usually a reformed private limited company. Like a private limited company, plcs are owned by shareholders. However, there is a fundamental difference - as the shares of a public company are traded on the stock exchange and can be bought by anyone. This enables the raising of stock capital.\n\nThere are also more high level requirements placed on the business, as more documents must be published - including public accounts.\n\nThis means that anyone can own part of the business if they purchase shares. However, the effective owner of the business is the majority shareholder - if there is one. \n\nDecisions will be made by the executive employees (such as the CEO) and the board (made up of major shareholders). This only covers major decisions, as more minor decisions will still be covered by lower levels of management.\n\nHostile takeovers are a higher risk for public limited companies as anybody is capable of purchasing shares. The setup cost is high, and shareholders will all expect a cut of the profits.\n\nThe shareholders all have limited liability.\n\nA plc is usually a lot bigger than a standard ltd company.\n\nShareholders have ultimate control over the business - however the majority shareholder, if one exists, has complete control. (Anyone with more than 50% of shares.)\n\nHere are some Plcs:\n\n- Admiral Group Plc\n- Aviva Plc\n- BP Plc\n- British American Tobacco plc\n- National Grid\n- Pheonix Group Holdings plc\n- Shell plc\n- Tesco plc\n\n## Business Research: Private Limited Companies\n\nPrivate limited companies can be really small all the way up to a large business. It is the simplest way to form a limited liability company and it has fairly low costs and requirements.\n\nIt only costs ¬£25 to register the company and needs shares to be assigned (if that method is used - persons of signifcant control can also be assigned). A ltd company is typically owned by one (or few) people who set it up. Shares are typically only owned by people directly involved with the company - and share capital is not usually a main source of finance.\n\nWithin a private limited company, the decision making is usually more central than with the typically larger plc. This is because in a private limited company, management is typically much smaller, possibly consisting of a single person. Therefore, a ltd is going to run more like a dictatorship, as one person *could* definitely have complete control over everything.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- owners have limited liability\n- individuals have the opportunity to become their own boss\n- new shareholders must be invited, preventing hostile takeover and divergence of interests.\n- shares can still be sold to raise money\n\n### Disadvantages:\n\n- there is frequently a lot of paperwork\n- sometimes financial information may end up being public\n- setup can be time consuming\n- the business may require professional help to manage finances\n\nControl is very central, as the owner of the business may choose to keep the whole organisation under their sole control, or delegate it as they choose.\n\nCorporation tax needs to be paid based on profits - meaning that the company may struggle to keep a positive balance.\n\nThe business is incorporated, and liability is limited - so the owners are protected from having their personal assets lost if something goes wrong with the business.\n\nPrivate limited companies tend to be smaller businesses, however there is no limit to the size of a ltd company - so some of them are very big. \n\n### Examples:\n\n- Contract West Limited\n- The Mill at Harvington Limited\n- Arrowtrack Limited\n- B Car Service Limited\n- Jacana Produce Limited\n- INEOS\n- Home Bargains\n- Thames Water\n- Radius Payment Solutions Ltd\n- Bet365\n\nBusinesses considering changing their form, may need to consider some points covered [here.](sixth/Business/Units/fh/CaseStudyStayingPrivate)\n\n## Business Research: Partnership\n\nA partnership is usually a smaller business, owned by a group of partners who usually all have specialisations in an area.\n\nWe frequently see partnerships operating as a firms such as solicitors, lawyers, dentists etc. The business is professional, but geared up to run at a relatively small scale.\n\n### Advantages:\n\n- deed of partnership can specify what profits each partner gets\n- they are quick and easy to setup\n- the owners have shared decision making\n- debt responsibility is split between owners\n\n### Disadvantages:\n- they can involve very long hours\n- conflict among owners can occur\n- there is the risk of unlimited liability\n- one partner may let the rest down if they don't uphold the standards of the business\n\nAll partners have shared control.\n\nFinance is provided by the partners, and profit is split between them. The \"deed of partnership\" denotes the specifics of this.\n\nThe business has unlimited liability - putting the partners at high risk.\n\nTypically, partnerships are small and do not grow much.\n\n### Examples:\n\n- JBW law\n- High Street dental practice\n- Merstow Green Medical Practice \n\n## Business Research: Sole Trader\nA sole trader is a common form of business where the owner of the business is the same legal entity as the business. They have unlimited liability, and fairly little legal protection. \n\nA sole trader is owned by a single person who runs the business.\n\nAll of the decision making is made by the singular owner.\n\n### Advantages\n- absolute control to the owner\n- still a legal business, can hire employees etc\n- lower turnover may remove VAT requirements\n\n### Disadvantages\n- unlimited liability\n- personal assets at risk\n\n---\n\nShareholders in **plc** and **ltd** companies can appoint a **Board of Directors** to make the decisions when it comes to running the business. The board appoints management staff of the business.\n\nEvery year, an annual general meeting (AGM) happens for any business. During this time, all shareholders may attend and vote to appoint the board of directors. Shareholder's influence over the vote is dictated by the percentage of shares that they own in the company.\n\nThe board typically aims to get a return on the shareholder's investments into the business.\n\nIn many smaller **ltd** companies, the same people will be shareholders, board members and senior managers in the organisation.\n\n---\n\n## Unincorporated vs Incorporated\n\n### Unincorporated\n- the owner **is** the business - no legal differences\n- owner has unlimited liability for business actions (including debt)\n- most unincorporated businesses operate as sole traders\n\n### Incorporated\n- legal difference between the business and the owners\n- owners/shareholders have limited liability\n- most incorporated businesses operate as private limited companies\n\n### Setting up a plc\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220920140004.png]]\n### Setting up a ltd\n![[content/sixth/Business/Units/fh/img/Pasted image 20220920140040.png]]\n\n---\nLimited companies have significantly more paperwork than unlimited companies. Accounts will be made public and avaliable for anyone who wants to access them, in a plc. Ltds will not have to have their accounts published.\n\nInvestors look for a return on their investment when they buy shares in a business. They would earn money back from dividends - or shares of the company profits.\n\nDividends can be paid annually or as interim dividends.\n\nThere are also [Public Sector](sixth/Business/Units/fh/PublicSector.md) businesses.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/EconomicGrowth":{"title":"Economic Growth","content":"\n## Market Conditions: Two Key Indicators\n\n**Economic Growth (GDP):** The level of demand in most markets is influenced by the rate of economic growth.

They operate everywhere‚Äîonly excluding North Korea. They do not sanction or treat different regions differently, which is seen as both good and bad. For instance, when lots of companies were pulling out of Russia‚ÄîValve made no comment or change. However, they do also persist in harder regions - as they have continued all operations in Ukraine.\n\nEconomic - Valve is largely unimpaired by the wider economy as they have created their own internalised Steam economic system. They are definitely still connected to the global economy though - and it does play a big role in their business. However, as they make billions in profit each year, they can afford to loose some of their money and tend not to make a change based on the economic climate.\n\nTechnological - Valve is a high tech organisation, their main product is Steam - a digital game, software and media distribution platform. They also produce games and hardware. This means that Valve tends to be at the cutting edge of technology. They have recently filed patents for BCIs (Brain Computer Interfaces), Nerve Manipulating Systems (allowing for the human nervous system to be manipulated to experience different sensations) and for technologies allowing for a false reality to be displayed to a user as a reality. \n\nLegal - Valve is largely unregulated, as many of their business models are yet to be monitored by the law. They do comply with laws, however do also have some business models that are potential risky - such as their microtransaction/gambling models that are used in some of their games. Largely, Valve is an ethical company, paying employees well and providing partners with a good range of services at a very reasonable price. But they are not perfect in this regard.\n\nEnvironmental/Ethical - Valve does not have a written ethical code, however they do react ethically in many situations. When underage gambling sites have existed around their products, they have forced these sites to close down as soon as they became aware of their existence. \n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/InterprettingMarketData":{"title":"Interpretting Market Data","content":"\n## Extrapolation\n\nUses trends from historical data to forecast the future.\n\n## Moving averages\n\nA moving average takes a data series and \"smoothes\" the fluctuations in data to show an average.

A price inelastic product will not notice much impact on demand if they increase prices.\n\nPetrol's elasticity depends on factors such as the number of nearby petrol stations, the need of customers to get petrol and various other factors. This means that petrol in a city would be fairly elastic, but fairly inelastic in the middle of nowhere.\n\nPrice elasticity  = % change in demand / % change in price\n\nExample of a product raising prices by 20%:\n\n- Server costs\n\t- May prompt to look for another provider\n\t- Current provider has several USPs, meaning that migration would likely be too much of a hassle\n\n---\nPrice elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in the price. We normally assume that a rise in price results in a fall in demand. The level of elasticity depends upon several factors including: the number of substitutes in the market which make it possible for customers to switch, whether the good is a necessity or a luxury and brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/ProductLifecycle":{"title":"Product Lifecycle","content":"\n1) convenience goods\n2) speciality goods\n3) 70% of new products fail within 3 years because entering the market is the most difficult part of a product lifecycle.

These are funded by central or local governments, but may still levy charges for some services.\n\nExamples: NHS, Highways Agency\n\n## Public vs Private sector\n\nPrivate sector companies frequently work to generate profit above all else. However, private sector works to provide a service or selection of goods **for all**.\n\n## Not For Profit Organisations\n\nNot for profit businesses trade to benefit the community. These businesses have social aims as well as trying to make money.\nExamples of social aims are job creation and training, providing community services and fair trade with developing countries.\n\n### Example: Divine Chocolate\n\nDivine chocolate ensures that they pay fair prices to the farmers in Ghana that produce the cocoa. This allows for investment to be made into the local community‚Äîimproving sanitation and infrastructure. Divine chocolate does not exploit the farmers, whereas historically many have been exploiting by western businesses.\n\n## Case Study: Horbury Plc\n\n1) Horbury had been impacted by economic pressures in the UK, as they sell products in industries such as ‚Äúmusic, entertainment, travel, and lifestyle‚Äù which are not classed as essential by many. Because of the economic status of the UK at this time people would have had less money to spend, and would have needed to prioritise the purchase of essentials, such as food, mortgages etc. As people would not have been purchasing electronic goods, Horbury plc would have experienced lower sales ‚Äì resulting in reduced profits or increased losses. Due to this reduction in business performance, shareholders may have been spooked and panic sold shares to recover some of their capital, thus reducing share prices.\n2) For the board to buy the company back and make it private, they would need a significant amount of funding. Whilst the board probably controls a large portion of the company already, it wouldn't be cheap to buy back the rest of the shares. Something that could be beneficial to Horbury going private is that they would gain more control, as they would have shares locked into a group of known individuals. They wouldn't have random investors controlling shares in the company, as every shareholder would have to be invited. This would allow them to benefit from longer term shareholders, who have an interest in the business greater than the chance of making a profit. \n\tAs a private company, Horbury would be under reduced scrutiny as they would no longer have to publicly release as much information about their business, and would be analysed less. However, it would be important for the board to understand that as a public company they can raise capital through the sale of shares, which becomes a much lengthier process if they become a private company‚Äîmeaning that changing business form would impact their ability to raise capital.\n\tThe company wants to diversify into more markets, and as a private company, they wouldn't be subjected to the whims of the shareholders as much. Instead, Horbury would be able to follow their own internal objectives without being worried about the share price.\n\n\tIn conclusion, Horbury should consider the pros and cons of each option, and take into account their current business plans and financial status before they commit to either decision. If they believe that it is worth it for them long-term, then they should become a private company. However, if they are looking to be able to raise capital quickly, then they should think twice before changing business form.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/RealIncome":{"title":"Real Incomes","content":"\n**Real incomes** measure the amount of disposable income available to consumers (eg, households \u0026 individuals).\n\n### Factors impacting real incomes:\n\n- inflation\n- wage growth\n- employment levels\n- interest rates\n- tax policies\n\n\nHousehold income is only one factor that impacts consumer spending.\n\n### Impacts of lower interest rates\n\n- Costs of servicing loans / debt is reduced‚Äîboosting spending power\n-  Consumer confidence should increase leading to more spending\n- Effective disposable income rises‚Äîlower mortgage costs\n- Business investment should be boosted eg, prospect of rising demand.\n- Housing market effects - more demand and higher property prices\n- Exchange rate and exports - cheaper currency will increase exports\n\n### Impacts of higher interest rates\n\n- Cost of borrowing rises\n- Main effect will be through mortgages \n- Add contraction in retail credit\n- Repayments on other debts\n- Possible slowdown in housing market\n- Higher rates might also cause currency to get stronger\n- Makes UK exports more expensive in overseas markets\n\n## Demographic Factors\n\nDemography is concerned with the size and composition of a population. Changes in population dynamics occur slowly but can be significant for business.\n\n## Practice Exercise 2\n1) Explain terms\n\t- interest rates‚Äîthe reward for saving or the cost for borrowing\n\t- market conditions‚Äîfactors that impact the market a business is operating in\n\t- demographic factors‚Äîthe makeup of the population that the business is operating in\n\t- environmental issues - whether a business can operate in an environmentally friendly way.\n2) Competition will split customers in the market between the competing businesses‚Äîthis will reduce the revenue of individual businesses, and require them to adapt and outwit their competition to become dominant. This will increase the costs of the businesses. Equally, the demand for goods or services provided in the market will likely increase due to marketing campaigns, however the demand for a specific business's services may decrease if they are not successful in their marketing efforts.\n3) If the average income of the population is decreasing in terms of value (not necessarily numbers), then the  amount of disposable income people have will decline. This will result in less money being spent on non-essential or luxury items‚Äîcausing these businesses to suffer from reduced revenue. Additionally, it will increase the chance of people opting for cheaper products when they have multiple options. So lower income will reduce the demand for luxury items, which will in turn reduce the revenue of businesses producing such items.\n4) If interest rates decline, then people with debts or mortgages will have less to pay back, and will therefore have more disposable income. This will lead to greater consumer spending. However, the long-term implication of this is that people saving will be making lower returns on savings‚Äîresulting in possible economic issues for them in future. If people were on a tighter budget before interest rates dropped, they may now have more money available to spend‚Äîresulting in an increased demand for luxury items and/or services. It is also possible that the demand for very cheap items will fall off‚Äîbecause people will be willing to spend their money on quality.\n5) If a business relies on borrowing money or trade credit to function, then higher interest rates will increase the amount that the business has to pay back on these borrowings. This will directly impact the costs of the business, and will possibly force the business to restructure their finances. Higher interest rates will also impact the customers that the business relies on to generate revenue, possibly forcing them to spend less or move to cheaper competitors. So when interest rates are high, it becomes important to consider costs to their customers, as if they are charging too much they may experience a sharp decrease in sales.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.607780389Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/fh/SegmentationTargetingAndPositioning":{"title":"Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning","content":"\nMarket segmentation involves dividing a market into parts that reflect different customer needs and wants.\n\n## STP model\n\n- Segmentation\n- Targeting \n- Positioning\n\n---\n\n### What is market segmentation?\n\nThe process of splitting the market into different demographics to help gauge where customer needs and wants.\n\n### Behavioural Segmentation\n\nAnalysing a market based upon factors such as habits like purchase frequency, method of purchase and other characteristics.\n\n### Geographic Segmentation\n\nDefining market categories based upon where people live.

This suggests that KPM has room to increase their output without pushing contingency margins too hard. New workers are inefficient until they have got integrated into the organisation fully, so turnover is bad for productivity in the factory. Luckily, the company is already addressing this as the turnover rate is reducing significantly.\n\nHowever, last year they were operating at 99% capacity, so the utilisation has dropped off significantly. KPM has clearly invested in improving the overall condition of their facilities, as well as capacity, but they have not scaled appropriately and now have wasted capacity. This is reflected by the higher unit costs this year. It would make sense for KPM to make the decision to employ more people in the factory, as a way to increase the capacity utilisation. Or if they felt that they did not need the extra capacity, they could reduce costs and scale back to a lower total capacity. This would be unlikely to be a good idea due to to the growing demand for their services. \n\n## To what extent do you agree that the decision to increase capacity from 545 tonnes to 830 tonnes was correct for KPM (16 marks)\n\nI do not believe that this increase in capacity was a good move for KPM. An increase in capacity was necessary, however they may have been overzealous in their increase, as they now have idling resources. Of course, we do not have information on their expected growth, so if they are expecting growth to continue rapidly, or a large spike in capacity demand, then running at 71% capacity may be a good choice for KPM.\n\nFor instance, if the extra capacity is the reason deliveries on time has increased by 6%, then they may see it as a worthwhile sacrifice because it will help their reputation. But the idle resources in the factory could be the reason, or part of the reason, behind the increase in unit costs. KPM are currently dealing with competition, which they have been managing to outcompete in pricing. Therefore, it is vital for KPM to ensure that their costs remain as low as possible, to enable them to profit from selling goods at a low price. Unused factory capacity will contribute to rising costs, which will increase the strain on their pricing model. If KPM falls behind in pricing, they will face a decline in sales and market share‚Äîwhich could be fatal for the business.\n\nBecause of the somewhat precarious situation the business is in‚Äîthe main objective should be managing competition and retaining or growing market share. It may be wise to temporarily reduce capacity. If possible, turning machines off when they aren't actively required, they could reduce their capacity to lower costs. \n\nAnother issue that KPM needs to consider is that the paper industry is in decline globally as everyone moves towards a digital solution. This means that the lifespan of the company is limited and if the market is shrinking, they need to diversify. Diversifying into another market could help save KPM from dying along with the paper industry, however if their plan is to diversify then they should focus on that rather than increasing factory capacity. The large multi-million pound investments in state-of-the-art machinery and new premises may not have been a wise choice, as these resources may have been better spent on migrating towards a new industry.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many different choices KPM could make, however the increased capacity is unlikely to be a good move in the long run due to market decline.\n\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.611780557Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CaseStudyDaihatsu":{"title":"Case Study: Daihatsu","content":"\n## To what extent is cutting prices a good way for any business to respond to a fall in the overall capacity utilization in its industry? (16m)\n\nWhen capacity utilization falls in an industry, it suggests that the overall demandüåüüåüüåü for the products produced by that industry has also fallen. This usually suggests that the business is operating in a market that produces luxury goods, such as Daihatsu producing their small cars. üåü\n\nBecause people do not need the industry to survive, the only realistic optionüåüüåü for businesses trying to exist in that market is for them to offer lower prices to consumers. A lower consumer price point means that regardless of the state of the economy or the consumer's personal finances, people will be more likely to purchase the business's goods.\n\nThis response will result in revenue being kept as high as possible for the business, which will be very important for keeping things afloat.\n\nThe problem that arises for a business such as Daihatsu offering lower prices is that due to their customizations, they cannot mass produce whole cars, meaning that their unit costs will already be higher than most of the industry. Because of this, they will be subjected to higher costs meaning that reducing their prices may require them to sacrifice some of their USP by reducing the customisability of their cars. Whilst this may be damaging to the business, it is likely that they would be able to continue operation as they would retain their reputation and grow their potential customer base. \n\nEffectively, businesses in industries where overall capacity utilisation is falling need to shift their focuses to different parts of the market to ensure that their longevity is secured. Cutting prices is a good way to reduce the impact of higher unit costs, meaning that for many businesses it will be a viable option.\n\n---\n# Feedback\n\n- Good, but narrow\n- Mention price elasticity of demand\n- Consider demand falling for short term\n\nüåü Not necessarily\n\nüåüüåü Really?

(9m)\n\nJayne has received instructions from her superiors and has made a decision to remedy the situation. However, when interacting with her employees, whilst she does listen to feedback, she does not take it on board. To make this work, she likely has to compromise with her subordinates to keep morale up. This places Jayne on the **Task Manager** corner of the Blake Mouton Grid - giving her a significant focus on achieving goals above anything else. Jayne does not adapt her plans based on the requests of her employees. She is told that some staff members may not be happy with travelling long distances (such as Scotland to London) for various reasons, including them being parents of young children. Whilst she does justify her decision as helping to prevent redundancies - she does not adapt it.\n\nIn a similar sense, she falls under the authoritarian segment of the tannenbaum schmidt continuum. This is because she has centralized the decision-making process, and is giving very little control to the people who her decision will impact. \n\nThis does not make Jayne a bad manager, however it does mean people may not feel comfortable around her or taking their problems to her. But at the end of the day, Jayne is not trying to create a Paternalistic environment, all she is focused on is the results. If she can get good results, then her subordinates keep their jobs and everyone can be happy. Because of this, Jayne could be seen as a good manager, but one that works employees hard.\n\n**Feedback:** Tells or Sells? First paragraph is strong, tannenbaum schmidt needs to be more precise.\n\n## To what extent might a change in Jayne's leadership style improve sales volume? (16m)\n\nUnder her current style, she will be suppressing the creativity of her employees. This is because they will feel like they just have to follow her orders and do everything to the letter. As they are working in the sales team, creative freedom will allow for new ideas to come to fruition and will allow all 25 members of staff to benefit the team at a higher level. However, on the flip side, moving to a different model, such as the democratic one, would have other effects than increasing the diversity of ideas. Some people may be less productive with more freedom, and some of the ideas that the team comes up with may not work out. Luckily, with a greater range of ideas the team is more likely to have a few good ones - whereas previously they would have been stuck with trying to make a single idea work.\n\nIf Jayne were to take this to an extreme and take a more Laissez-faire approach to leadership, she would be taking a much higher risk, but also possibly looking at a much higher potential reward. As long as the team she is managing consists of skilled people whom are capable of working well indepndently from each other, then she should be able to increase productivity by taking a backseat on some of the decision making. \n\nDespite all the potential positives of a more relaxed management style, her current approach with her new plan may be just as, if not more, successful. Jayne is a good sales person, who has been promoted to her position for a reason - and therefore the company has trusted her to do a good job. Whilst sales have decreased since last year, this may not be reflective of sales efforts and simply due to an increasingly digital world. Jayne does have a plan, and as long as she can ensure her team executes it effectively - it should have some success. \n\nIn conclusion, Jayne may be perfectly fine where things are - and would be taking the least risk by changing nothing. However, moving towards greater employee freedom may be incredibly beneficial and boost productivity more than Jayne could manage under her authoritarian style. The problem with a new approach is that the outcome is unknown - so the risk is high.\n\n**Feedback:** Good understanding. To get higher marks, make less points and go into more detail. Also needs evaluation.\n\n## Leadership Styles Research\n\n**McDonald's**: They have an effective leadership style, because staff working there are typically low skilled. So they delegate from a business manager to a general manager, and then down to shift managers who give instructions to the crew members. As you move higher up the ladder, it becomes less authoritarian as a higher skill level is assumed. This does cause some issues, but most of them are minor and can be easily resolved.\n\n**Nando's**: Managers are reportedly very imposing and stressed. They are not paid much more than the lowest level workers, but are given a lot more responsibility and are expected to run everything. This results in the managers not caring much for the business or their work and results in a more impoverished management style. Becuase of this there are employees who do not feel satisfied with the Nando's management style.\n\nA significant amount of data for this research was found on [Breakroom](https://breakroom.cc)\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.611780557Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/CaseStudyStakeholders":{"title":"Case Study: Stakeholders","content":"\n1) The local community would stand to benefit from Roxio's offerings. The availability of food, clothing, electronics and other basic items would improve the quality of life in the local area. This would encourage the community to support the opening of a new store. Whilst there may be drawbacks, such as traffic influxes and rubbish management issues - these will probably be seen as worth it for the availability of more amenities and essentials.\nA large factor that may impact the community views on this proposition is the presence of local businesses that are involved in similar markets to Roxio. If there are a few small, independent shops in the town or village, then Roxio may be viewed as being monopolistic by trying to dominate the market. However, it may be that there is a severe lack of shops, or that the market overlap is not absolute - which would result in Roxio still being able to enter the area without causing friction with the locals.\n\n\n2) Whilst Roxio does initially need to please shareholders, they shouldn't overlook the other stakeholders, nor their combined power. Individually, the shareholders have the most influence over the business, but the customers and employees are both vital to it being able to function, and either group could cease operation of the business. Therefore, it is important for Roxio to prioritize the needs and wants of all of their stakeholders proportionately. Only by properly understanding where people stand with relation to the business will Roxio be able to develop their plans. \nTherefore, Roxio should listen to the complaints of the local communities that they are looking to enter, and instead of ignoring them, they should take steps to meet a compromise. If they appear as a human organisation rather than a robotic one, people will be more likely to accept their presence, even if they initially opposed it. \n\nFurthermore, the government is a powerful entity that could have a massive impact on the business. Roxio should take steps to ensure that the government concerns about their market share do not result in any major action against the company. Again, this will likely result in compromise such as them having to slow their growth plans to fall below the radar of government monitoring agencies.\n\nIn conclusion, the shareholders are only one stakeholder group - in a business the size of Roxio's it is important that they are taking appropriate time to understand and meet the needs of all of their stakeholders. Whilst they may choose their shareholders as priority #1, they cannot be priority 1/1.\n\n[Business](/Business)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.611780557Z","tags":null},"/sixth/Business/Units/nd/DangersofCapacityUtil":{"title":"Dangers of Capacity Utilisation","content":"\n## Initial Questions\n\n1) Capacity utilisation is calculated as\nused capacity/total capacity x 100\n\n2) 13,000 capacity\n11,500 produced (2020)\n14,000 produced (2021)\n\n11,500/13,000 x 100 = 88.46%\n\n14,000/13,000 x 100 = 107.69%\n\nUtilisation change = 19.23%\n\n\n3) Running at high capacity utilisation means high efficency, so you are maximising profits.\n\n4) Running at high utilisation  does not protect against contingencies.

HOWEVER - there is not set syntax rules and ideas can be expressed more freely.\n\nIt is more natural for programmers to work with pseudo code than any of the other methods.\n\nNo rules as such, but it is conventional to declare the end of an IF, WHILE or something else.\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.627781227Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/Programming":{"title":"Programming","content":"\nAlgorithms are instructions.\n\nComputer process instructions.\n\nProgramming is the process of turning algorithms into instructions that can be followed by a computer.\n\nInstructions are binary codes that represent the operations that the computer can perform.\n\nSo `0001` could be ADD and `0010` could be SHIFT.\n\nEach type of computer has its own set of instructions - creatively called an instruction set, examples of these include x86 and ARM.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n### 1st Generation\n- Machine code\n- Binary\n\t- Eg - 0001010 could be the code for `ADD` on your processor.\n\n### 2nd Generation\n- Assembly code\n- One-to-one equivalence to machine code\n\t- We would use a command word like `ADD` instead of a binary representation, because it is easier to remember\n\n### 3rd Generation (or high level)\n- High level languages are portable\n\t- They will run on different platforms (such as Linux x86 and Android ARM)\n- They are natural-like\n\t- A single high level instruction (such as `print`) would turn into many low level instructions.\n\nIn 1st and 2nd generation languages (the low level languages) the programmer needs to know and think about how the computer works.\n\nWith 3rd generation/ high level languages - the programmer focuses on solving the problem more than on how the computer works.\n\n\n### Low level languages\nAlways called:\n\n- Machine code: the binary codes that instruct the computer on what to do.\n- Assembly code: the code word equivalent of machine code\n- Sometimes they may include the chipset, eg x86 machine code.\n\n### High level languages\nUsually referred to by the language name:\n- Python, C, Basic, Pearl, PHP, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, HTML etc etc etc\n\n#### Why so many?\n- Different languages have different strengths and weaknesses\n- Some are compiled, some are interpreted.\n- Some are focused on particular applications, such as business, engineering or games etc.\n\n## Rosetta Code\nA stone was discovered holding the \"Rosetta code\" which includes a message in 3 different languages, 1 of which was hieroglyphs. We couldn't understand hieroglyphs until we found this stone, however once we used the Rosetta code to translate the message on the stone, we managed to crack hieroglyphs.\n\nSimilarly, the website [RosettaCode.org](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) allows you to compare programming languages similarly. It has solutions to different tasks in many different languages.\n\n\n## Translators\n\n- Source code **needs** to be translated into object code.\n- Object code is combined with other object code to create machine code before it can run.\n\t- Examples of object code could be other translated source code or standard libraries provided with languages.\n\n| **Source Code** | _Machine Code_ | _Assembly Code_ | _High Level Code_                                      |\n| --------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Translate**   | N/A            | Assembler       | Compiler / Interpreter                                 |\n| **Combine**     | Linker         | Linker          | Linker (usually automated) Interpreter bypasses linker |\n| **Executable**  | Machine Code   | Machine Code    | Machine Code                                           |\n\nAssembly has a 1:1 equivalence with machine code. It is the exact same, just represented with keywords rather than binary.\n\n## Compiler or Interpreter\n\n- Compiler\n\t- The source code is translated into object code\n\t- This only needs to be done once\n\t- The result is machine code that will run very quickly\n\t- No other software is needed to be supplied to the user\n- Interpreter\n\t- The source code is interpreted by a special program at run time.\n\t\t- The source code, effectively, calls upon pre-built routines in the interpreter.\n\t- This must be done every time the program is run\n\t- Interpreted programs do not execute as quickly as compiled code.\n\t- You must provide the end user with a copy of the interpreter AND your source code.\n\n## Errors\n- When writing code, we should expect a few errors\n\n- Errors fit into three classifications\n\t- Syntax Errors: the grammar of the statement is wrong\n\t- Runtime Errors: the program has received some wrong data that it cannot process\n\t- Semantic Errors (logical errors): the program gives the wrong result.\n\n## Exceptions\n- Exceptions happen when something exceptional (unexpected) happens.\n- This is often an error, although it doesn't mean the error is unexpected\n\t- The programmer can write exception handling routines to deal with these situations\n- Throwing, catching and fatal errors.\n\t- When an exception happens, we describe this as throwing an error.\n\t- Having a routine to deal with it is called catching an error.\n\t- A fatal error would be an error that is thrown but for which there is no catch routine.\n\n- When an error gets thrown:\n\t- The current process gets suspended.\n\t- The exception handling routine is called‚Äîif it exists.\n\t\t- If there is none, the program crashes.\n- The original routine is restored.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220928120809.png]]\nThe above diagram shows the flow if the exception is caught. If it is uncaught, then it will just crash.\n\n## Development Lifecycle\n\n- Initiation‚Äîwhat needs to happen. \n- Feasibility study‚Äîcan I solve this problem? Is it affordable?\n- Analysis‚Äîwhat is the problem? Legal limitations?\n- Planning‚Äîhow are we going to achieve the goal? What needs changing? Who is doing what?\n- Design‚ÄîCreating flowcharts, pseudocode, FSMs etc.\n- Development‚ÄîWriting the code, creating databases etc\n- Installation/ roll-out‚ÄîPut everything into a production environment, ensure it is working.\n- Training‚ÄîMake sure the people who need to use the product can use the product.\n- Maintenance‚ÄîFixing issues, ensuring performance and security are up to standard. Keeping the system ticking over.\n\nThis is not a rigid list, not everyone uses every stage, and not everybody does them in the order used here. Some people may collapse stages into larger categories.\n\nYou can go back through phases if an issue arises.\n\n[Planning is important!](sixth/CompSci/Programming/Planning)\n\n\n[Majority of programming work is found on GitHub](sixth/CompSci/Programming/ProgrammingChallenges)\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.627781227Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/ProgrammingChallenges":{"title":"Programming Challenges","content":"\n\nSee programming challenges from Comp Sci here: [Crispy Fiesta](https://github.com/isaluki/crispy-fiesta)\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.627781227Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/StateMachines":{"title":"State Machines","content":"\n## Finite State Machines\n An FSM shows the states in which a system can exist, what causes the system to move from one state to another, and what outputs or changes the transition causes.\n\nThe system must have a known (finite) number of states.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220920143733.png]]\n\nFSMs can be converted into a circuit, meaning that they can be used to control things such as traffic lights without the need for actual code.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220920145051.png]]\nStates are connected by transitions (arrows).

They are ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways.\n\nWhereas a formal language is like a formula in maths or science and programming languages. It can only be interpreted in a single way and is very rigid.\n\n\n### Algorithms\n\nTypically, an algorithm will use a formal language (or will be much closer to formal than natural). A recipe is an example of an algorithm that can be represented using natural languages, with a more formal structure. A recipe can be misinterpreted, a program cannot.\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.627781227Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Programming/Subroutines":{"title":"Subroutines","content":"\nInstead of writing a huge, monolithic piece of code, you can break a program down into smaller pieces, called subroutines. These allow for increased modularity in an application. It also makes it much easier to work on a project with multiple people involved because they can each write subroutines to work together and produce a complex system quickly.\n\nIt is much easier to solve a problem by breaking it down into subroutines.\n\nAll subroutines are reusable, meaning that if you write a utility to authenticate a user, you can call the same subroutine from multiple places, keeping code tidy and reducing time-wasting.\n\nHere is an example subroutine written in Python:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(1,2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nWhen this code is executed, it will return the literal `3`. This is because we pass the values `1` and `2` to the subroutine, which then adds them together. The answer is printed out because we save the result in a variable and then display it with the `print` command.\n\nHere is a demonstration of the program being executed:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908123946.png]]\n\nTaking this a step further, we could ask the user to pick the values to add together. We would do this using the following code:\n\n```py\n# Define the subroutine\ndef AddNum(num1,num2):\n    return (num1+num2)\n\n# This could be more efficient, and will crash if we enter an invalid input.\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter num1: \"))\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter num2: \"))\n\n\n# Call the subroutine\naddition = AddNum(num1,num2)\nprint(addition)\n```\n\nAnd the result looks like this when we run it:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Programming/img/Pasted image 20220908124522.png]]\n\n## Types of subroutine\n\n\u003e [!abstract] In terms of Python\n\u003e\n\u003e The following uses Python keywords as examples, but the same logic can be applied to any language.\n\nBecause this code uses the `return` keyword, it is a **function**.\n\nThe other type of subroutine is a **procedure**, this would not use the `return` keyword.\n\nA procedure does not return any value to the logic that called it, whereas a function does. This is the only difference between the two types.\n\nA function would typically be used where a response is needed or the status of the action needs verifying. If you do not need an answer, then a procedure may be the best choice.\n\nSubroutines are made out of the basic [building blocks](sixth/CompSci/Programming/BuildingBlocks) found here.\n\n## Task: Write a subroutine\n\nA procedure that:\n- Receive a person's name\n- Adds \"from PHHS\" to the name\n- Prints the product\n- Ends\n\n```py\ndef FromPHHS(name):\n\tprint(name+\" from PHHS\")\n```\n\nNext, a function to convert celsius to fahrenheit:\n\n```py\ndef CelToFaren(celsius):\n\tfahren = celsius * 1.8 + 32\n\treturn fahren\n```\n\n\u003e [!info] Identifiers\n\u003e\n\u003eJust like with variables, the name of a subroutine is officially called an identifier. Also - just like with variables - the identifier should be descriptive as it improves code readability.\n\nTo extend the functionality of a subroutine (or any of your code), modules are very useful.

So if it is contained within a variable - it is a value.\n\n---\n## Expression\nAn **expression** is an operation of values and/or variables that will result in a value.\n\nTypically, you get a different value output than the input - as you are performing a mathematical operation usually (and most of the time you won't  be doing a * 1 operation).\n\nExamples:\n\n- 32 * 4\n- 15 - 2\n- 43 / 7\n- 3 == 5\n- \"hello\" + \"world\"\n- 4 \u003e 2\n- \"hello\" * 4\n- input(\"What is your name? \") * 6\n- ((12 * 6) /4 ) + 8\n\nExpressions are used to modify or compare values. They may contain a function call (ie, `int(3.4) * 5` is still an expression).\n\nData Types do matter in expressions - so whilst you can multiply a string by an integer, you cannot divide a string by an integer.\n\nSo `Bob * 4` is valid and results in \"BobBobBobBob\"\n\nBut `Bob / 2` is not valid and will return an error.\n\nA division operation will **always** return a float - even if the inputs were integers.\n\n---\n## Statement\nA **statement** is any valid fragment of code.

It indicates whether there should be an odd or even number of bits turned ON (binary 1s). If the check bit does not match the rest of the word, then the data is corrupted.\n- The sender and receiver must agree to use parity checking and whether this is to be odd or even.

Each class is taught in a single room. Students can study more than one subject but teachers can only teach one subject.*\n\n\u003e Identify the entities.\n \n- What is an entity is a discussion, not a given. Things that the database needs to track are entities.\n- Some entities may be physical - such as a teacher - whilst some are just concepts - such as a subject.\n\n\n**Entities:** school, classes, teacher, room, students, subject\n\nThe school may want additional entities, such as reports, registers, books, invoices etc. It simply depends upon the use case for the database and what the school wishes to track/do with the databse.\n\nSome entities may not be needed. So for instance a school would not be required in this database as all data is stored solely for the school - if multiple schools needed to use this database then the school entity might make sense. So we can exclude **school** from our entity list.\n\nNext, we take **all** of the entities and think about how they are related to **all other** entities.\n\n### Naming conventions\n\nEntities should be named in a uniform way. The convention is to be consistent and people typically name everything in the singular. \n\nSo we would store *classes* as *class* and *students* as *student*.\n\nThis does not technically matter in terms of database performance or functionality, it's just something that makes it easier for humans to understand.\n\n### Relationships\n\nThere are 3 types of relationship possible between entities.\n\n#### One-to-one\n\n- For each single item a link exists to another single item. \n- So one alarm links to one house. An alarm cannot be installed in multiple houses, and the imaginary security company only installs one alarm per house.\n\n#### One-to-many\n\n- For one single item, a link exists to multiple other items. \n- For example, a supplier may have mutliple products.\n\nHeinz is the supplier of baked beans and ketchup. However ketchup and baked beans only have 1 supplier, whilst Heinz has 2 products in this scenario.\n\n*Each product can only have 1 supplier.*\n\n#### Many-to-many\n\n- For each single instance there are links to and from multiple other instances of a different entity.\n- A subject can be taught by many teachers and teachers can teach many subjects.\n\n![Relationship Types](/content/sixth/compsci/theory/databases/img/relationshiptypes.png)\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.655782399Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Databases/Overview":{"title":"Databases: Overview","content":"\n## Data vs Information\n\n### Data\n\n- Values from a source where there is no context.\n    - 16.7\n    - True\n    - Baker\n\n### Information\n\n- Values given context and therefore meaning.\n    - Today's maximum temperature is 16.7 celcius\n    - Are you passing your course? true\n    - Customer's Last Name: Baker\n\nBecause of this, it would make more sense to describe a database as an \"informationbase\".\n\n\n\u003e Knowledge is power.\n\n\n\n## What is a database?\n\n- Put simply it is\n    - persistent - it's not volatile\n    - organised - we know where things are and where things go\n    - information - it has context so we can make sense of it\n\n## Why are databases used?\n\n- Provide a centralised store for all of our information.\n    - Making sure that all users can see the same data.\n- Allow fast and accurate access to the information.\n    - For analysis and reporting.\n- Allow multi-user access.\n    - From different locations and devices.\n- Keep the data accurate.\n    - Validating the inputs and only storing each piece of information once.\n- Keeping the data secure.\n    - Authenticating users and only showing them data they're allowed to see.\n\n\n---\n\n## Legalities\n\n- The law says that data must be secure and accurate\n    - Data Protection Act (DPA)\n    - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)\n\n- We must ensure that they stay accurate, not just because the law says so. \n    - If you move house, it is important that your bank knows this.\n    - If I delete a supplier from my system, what about products that they sold us and that we sold onto our customers?\n\nResponsibility for the safety of information relies partially on the organisation to set and enforce policies, but the individual can be liable if they go against their organisation's policies. \n\nIf someone has information stored about you, then they are legally required to give it all to you upon request within a reasonable amount of time. Some organisations are exempt from this, such as the police and various security services. Information may be withheld if the usecase of the requester is suspected to be malicious, however this becomes more complex as anyone you have data on still has their rights. \n\nOrphaned data is information that has been disconnected from linked data points. So if you have a product from a supplier and you delete the supplier from your database, then the product has no supplier. This means that the product would be orphaned.\n\n\n\n## Worksheet\n\n### Farm\n\nA databse may be used on a farm to keep track of the status of various crops, equipment and balances. This data would be useful to help the farm analyse where their money comes from by identifying the most profitable crops - and then linking this to the equipment used for those crops. Later this may lead to the farm making different decisions based on how they want to operate, for instance they may not want to grow certain crops or use certain equipment if they have identified any potential issues with it. Automatic management of different stock levels (fertilisers etc) could also be enabled through the use of a database combined with automation.\n\n### Website\n\nA website may wish to track visitors to the site and store this information in a database. If, for example, the website was providing a media sharing service, then this analytical data could be used to find out what media is most popular in different regions. This could help the website target their advertising to these regions, and ensure that any local languages are supported. Additionally, it may be possible for the website to decide where to focus development efforts when they see that 70% of their traffic comes from users on mobile devices. This means it would be a good idea for them to put resources into improving their website experience on mobile form factors.\n\n### Restaurant\n\nIf a restaurant serves 60 different dishes, there will likely be dishes that are more popular than others. If every time somebody orders something it is recorded in a database, then it would be possible for the restaurant to ensure that they always have the correct ingredients avaliable to provide customers with their favourite dinner dishes on Thursdays. Additionally, it would allow the restaurant to review the performance of different dishes and remove less popular ones from their menu. Another datapoint that the restaurant could get from collecting this information is populatirty based on time and day. They could look at when the most orders are coming in and ensure that they always have enough staff on shift on a Saturday morning whilst also making sure that on a Monday morning they have a much more minimal staff, optimising both costs and customer experience.\n\n\n### The Law\n\n1) Describe the nature of content and purpose\n2) Assess the necessity and compliance measures\n3) Identify and evaluate potential risks to data subjects\n4) Identify any additional actions that could mitigate those risks\n\n### Database Management Systems\n\n- Provides additional security\n- Sharing of data and multi user transaction processing becomes possible\n\n- Allow remote access of data\n    - Enables applications and employees to work across the world\n\n- Greatly simplified bulk operations and queries\n    - Runs queries and operations much faster due to a dedicated design\n\n\n- DBMS are more complex than flat files - a standard user cannot directly interface with it.\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.655782399Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/DecimalPoints":{"title":"Decimal Points","content":"\nDecimal points separate whole numbers from their fractional part.\n\nConsider a binary number as 1001 . 1010\nthe first part, 1001 is equivalent to 9 \nwhilst the second part is equal to 0.625 (0.5 + 0.125), making the whole number 9.625\n\n\n\n## Converting denary to binary\n\n11.75 -\u003e 11 | 0.75\n11 = 1011\n0.75 = 0.11\n\n11.75 -\u003e 1011.11\n\n\n\nFixed point binary system:\n\n\n- It can be noted that using this method, only certain fractional parts can be represented.\n- In other words, only the fractional numbers that can be written as a sum of those numbers specified in the table can be converted to binary using this method accurately.\n- Consider an 8-bit register, using two bits for the fractional part means there will be only 6 bits to store the whole number. \n\n\n17.5\n\n-\u003e 17 | 0.5\n\n16 8 4 2 1 \n1  0 0 0 1\n\n0.5\n0.1\n\n10001.10\n\n(correct, use longer word length)\n\n-17.5 \n01110.01\n\n\n32.015625\n32 | 0.015625\n\n32 16 8 4 2 1\n1      0 0 0 0 0\n\n0.15625\n\n0.5 -\u003e 0.25 -\u003e 0.125 -\u003e 0.0625 -\u003e 0.03125 -\u003e0.015625\n0.00001\n\n100000.00001\n\n## Floating-point numbers\n\n1.3x10^7\n\n^7 is an *exponent*\n\n1.3 is the mantissa\n\n\n1234 = 0.1234 x 10^4\n\n\nStep 1 ) Find exponent and check sign bit\n\nStep 2 ) Modulate the mantissa by the exponent\n\n\nMantissa is the actual number\nThe exponent is the modifier to be applied to the mantissa.\n\nFPB: 001010.01\n\n  32 16 8 4  2 1 . 1/2 1/4\n\n10.25\n\n1001.0010\n\n17.125\n\t(Incorrect, negative due to sign bit)\n\n-17.5 to bin\n\n1001.1\n\n---\n\n0.111 010\n\nExponent = 2\n011.1010\n3 + 1/2 + 1/8 = 3.625\nMantissa = 3.625\n\n0.110111 0100\nExponent = 4\nMantissa = \n\n-32 16 8 4 2 1\n1       1   0 1 1 1\n\n-32 + 16 + 4 + 2 +1 = -9 \n\nAct: 13.75\n\n## Rounding Errors\n- Binary hits some issues when we deal with some numbers that aren't factors of 2.\n- It can't be done accurately, we have to settle on being as close as possible.\n\n### Absolute Error\n- The difference between the number you're trying to calculate and the number you've managed to store.\n\n### Relative Error\n- Essentially the same as a relative error, but it is expressed as a percentage.\n- It gives us an idea of the scale of the error that we're dealing with and how much we can trust the numbers.\n\n- Divide the absolute error by the number that we're trying to represent, and times the result by 100 to get a percentage.\n- So 0% is entirely accurate, and 100% is completely inaccurate.\n- The closer the percentage value is to 0, the greater the accuracy of the number.\n\n\n\nTarget Number: 25000\nAbsolute Error: 0.5\nRelative Error: 0.002%\n\nTarget Number: 100\nAbsolute Error: 0.5\nRelative Error: 0.5%\n\nTarget Number: 5000\nAbsolute Error: 0.5\nRelative Error: 0.01%\n\nTarget Number: 10\nAbsolute Error: 0.00000005\nRelative Error: 0.0000005%\n\n---\n\n#### FLOP to Denary\n\n0.010 0110\n\nExponent:  6\n\n0.010\n\n0.100\n1.0000\n10\n100\n1000\n10000\n 16   8  4   2  1\n\n16\n\n0.1101 011\n\nExponent: 3\n\n0110.1\n    4 2. 1/2 \n\n6.5\n\n---\n## Normalisation\n\nThe process of improving the accuracy of a number with decimal points.\n\n46321 (denary) can be represented as 0.46321x10^4\n0.00463x10^6 ( less accurate)\n\nOut of these representations, the first is the most precise.\n\nThis same logic can be applied to **binary numbers**. \n\nAn unormalised positive number consists of a sign bit (0) and one or more zeros after the decimal point.\n\nFor a normalised positive binary number, the sign bit is 0 and the bit after the sign bit is *always* 1.\n\nTo normalise a binary number, there must be a 1 after the decimal point.

This allows for reduced storage size.\n\t\t- ![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111133942.png]]\n\n### Uncompressed Image Files\n- TIFF (.tif) and bitmap (.bmp) are examples of uncompressed image files.\n\n## Different types of image files\n- PNG‚ÄîLossless - Used for transferring images over the internet\n- JPEG‚ÄîLossy - Higher compression rate than a PNG. Used in digital cameras and webpages.\n- GIF‚ÄîLossy - A sequence of frames that can be replayed to produce a short animation.\n\n## Compressing video files\n- A typical HD video has a frame rate of 60 fps. The sampling rate of the video is given in frames per second.\n- Video files also have a bit rate that defines the quality of video and audio.\n- Compressing video files allows you to do more with less bandwidth when streaming videos.\n\n## Streaming audio files : MP3\n- Compression is very helpful when streaming audio and video files.\n- MP3 file format is used for audio compression.\n- MP3 allows for up to 90% compression.\n- Even though MP3 files cannot match original CD quality, they provide a satisfactory experience.\n- Mp3 is lossy compression for an audio file.\n- A user does not hear a difference between MP3 and CD because only a few parts of the file are removed.\n- FLAC and ALAC are examples of open source lossless compression. Up to 50% size reduction with no noticable difference to quality.\n\n## Streaming video files : MP4\n- MP4 files allow the storage of audio and video.\n- Video files are compressed into MP4 format to stream online. This file is used for transmission over digital channels, cables and satellites. \n- DVD movies are also available in this format, coming over from MP2.\n\n## Run-length encoding (RLE)\n\nA form of lossless compression where repeated bits are stored together. Good if there is high repetition, but it can sometimes be inefficient.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111135354.png]]\n\nIn video files, RLE works between frames, allowing for unchanging colours to stay as they are without using additional bandwidth.\n\nThis can cause screen tearing when it isn't working properly.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111135830.png]]\n\n## Huffman coding\n- A compression technique used to reduce the number of bits that represent each letter.\n- A binary tree is used to encode letters.\n- A binary tree is a data structure made of nodes and is constructed based on a hierarchy. A parent node in a binary tree has up to 2 child nodes.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111140114.png]]\nSo to say AB in this tree, you would use:\n`1110`\n\nIn Huffman coding, the more frequently used characters require less bits to represent.\n\nAnother, more complex tree, as an example:\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221111140336.png]]\n\n### How to build a binary tree\n- We need the lowest number of bits for letters with a higher frequency\n- So start with the least frequent characters, and work upwards.\n- When two nodes are close together, create a root node above to link them together.\n- When following a tree down, each possible path should terminate at a valid \"leaf\".\n\n## Encryption\n\n- The process of changing data into another form or code so that only people with access to a secret key can read it. For others, the message would be unreadable.\n\n### Caesar Cypher\n- A very simple substitution cypher. Each letter of the alphabet is shifted by a certain number of characters. A shift left of 2, would make \"abc\" become \"cde\".\n- A shift of 5 on the message \"INITIATE PLAN A\" would become \"NSNYFJ UQFS F.\"\n- Easy to decrypt, as it is vulnerable to brute force attacks and frequency analysis.\n- Longer messages are easier to decode than shorter ones.\n\n### The Vernam cypher\n- The Vernam cypher uses a one-time pad or an encryption key.\n- Encryption key: its length is equal to the length of characters, or greater than that. They keys are only used once.\n- Sender and receiver meet in person to exchange the keys and destroy them after the exchange of messages.\n- The sole mathematically unbreakable code found so far: RSA, PGP etc can be broken given enough time and computing power.\n\n- Keys can also be called salts\n- Vernam cypher works with the ASCII codes of characters. Each ASCII code is taken in binary form.\n- The one-time key is also taken in binary form.\n- An XOR operation is performed between the key and the data to produce cypher text. An XOR operation is reversible, and therefore the same method can be used to decrypt the message.\n\n\n\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.655782399Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/Hex":{"title":"Hex","content":"\n#### Recall: Two's Complement\n-20\n10100\n\n010100\n101011\n\n_101100_\n\n\n-32\n100000\n0100000\n1011111\n110000\n\n-20 + 16\n101100c\n\n+\n\n10000\n010000\n\n1011111\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |\n1\t0\t1\t*1*\t0\t*1*\t0\t\t1\t1\t\n\n1010011\n\n\n\n-39 -83\n\n39\n\n101001\n\n83\n\n101011\n\n0101001\n0101011\n\n1010110\n1010100\n\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n| *0* | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n|  Carries: | 1 |   | 1 |   |   |   |\n\n0001010\n\n-21 + 37\n\n21\n\n010101\n\n37\n\n100101\n\n\n0010101\n0100101\n\n# Hexadecimal\n\nHex is a base 16 system, each nibble is can be represented with 1 digit.\n\nIt is easier to use for humans than basic binary.\n\nThe memory location in a computer is stated in hexadecimal form.

If an extra bit is added, we get an overflow error.\n\nThe number of bits a register can hold is called the word size.

This is why we need floating point handling.\n\nCircular right shifts exist to maintain number length in binary representation. So when shifting right, a zero will be moved to the leftmost part of the number. \n\nA larger number can be stored across multiple numbers. So a 16-bit number can be stored across 2 8-bit registers.\n\nTo divide a 16-bit number by 2 in an 8-bit processor:\n\n- Shift the contents of Reg A to the right\n- Perform a circular right shift in Reg B\n\nThere is a Carry Bit -

If samples are played together at a high enough rate, sound that is close to the original can be played.\n\n## Factors Impacting Audio Quality\n- Sampling Rate: Number of samples per second\n- Bit depth: Number of bits used to represent each clip\n- Bit rate: Number of bit used per second of audio\n\n## Sampling Rate\n- Number of samples taken per second\n- The higher the rate, the greater the detail of the sound\n- Unit of sampling is represented in Hz\n- Each sample represents the amplitude of the wave at a certain point in time.\n- The most common sampling rate for music is 44,100 samples per second which is 44,100Hz (44.1kHz)\n- A VOIP typically has a sampling rate of 8kHz, which is enough for a human voice to be heard quickly, but the quality is reduced to a certain extent.\n\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017102345.png]]\n\n## Frequency\n- The number of oscillations per second is called frequency\n- It is measured in Hz and controls the pitch of the sound\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221017102533.png]]\n\n## Nyquist's Theorem\n- The theorem states that:\n\t- For accurate sampling, the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency of the highest frequency in the original sound signal.\n\t- When sampling rate is less than the frequency suggested by the theorem, the recording will not be accurate to the original sound.\n\n## Bit Depth\n- Bit depth is the number of bits available for each sample\n- The higher the bit depth, the higher the quality of the audio\n- A CD has a bit depth of 16 bits, and a DVD has a bit depth of 24 bits\n- An n bit system can have 2^n different values.\n\n### PCM\n- High-quality audio files are created as pulse-code modulation (PCM)\n- WAV or AIFF are uncompressed examples\n- The pulses of the induced electrical signal in the microphone\n\n## Bit Rates\n- The amount of data sampled per second (kbps)\n- **Bit rate = sampling rate x bit depth x channels**\n- Typically, stereo is the minimum channel count (2 channels)\n\n### Audio Quality\n- A reasonable music audio must have a minimum bit rate of 128bkps.\n- The greater the bit rate, the higher the quality.\n- This is why the audio quality of a CD is higher than that of Spotify.\n- Tidal is a music streaming solution that provides the highest streaming quality over the internet.\n\n## Analogue to Digital conversion\n\n- An analogue signal is a continuous signal which represents physical measurements.\n- A signal from a microphone is an example of an analogue signal.\n- However, a digital signal is a discrete signal that uses discontinuous data.\n\n## File size check\n- 24 bit depth\n- 2 channel - L \u0026 R\n- Sample rate 16kHz\n- 2.5 minutes long\nsample rate *  bit depth * channels \n\n24 x 16000 x 2 = 768kbps\n768000 x 150= 115200000 bits\n/ 8 = 14.4 MB\n\n## (Musical Instrument Device Interface) MIDI\n\n- A communication protocol that enables electronic musical instruments to interact with each other using information and control signals.\n- Asynchronous serial 8-bit transmission\n- MIDI file instructs device on how to produce a musical note using several commands.\n- A command is identified by its specific sequence of bits.\n- You can think of it as the musical equivalent of an `SVG` file.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221107101325.png]]\n\n### Types of bytes\n- Status bytes\n\t- Indicates instruments about the type of action to be performed\n\t- The action of 16 channels are represented in this byte\n\t- Notes are ON or OFF\n\t- Key pressure‚Äîhow hard a key is pressed\n- Data bytes\n\t- Information to status bytes\n\t- Pitch byte: denotes note to be played\n\t- Velocity note: denotes the loudness of the note.\n\n- Using a MIDI file, music identical to the original can be played every time.\n- A sequence program is required so that commands can be recognised.\n- Smaller in size than MP3\n- MIDI does not contain any audio track\n- Used in web pages, ringtones etc\n- Used for creating electronic orchestras.\n\n---\n1) Bit depth of 8 bits, what value range can be represented?\n2^n = 2^8 = 256\n2) Calculate the bit rate of a 32-bit system with a sampling rate of 44,100 samples per second and 2 channels.\n32 * 44100 * 2 = 2822400 bits\n \n2822.4kbps\n\n3) What is the file size of a 4-minute song with bit rate of question 2/\n2,822,400 * 240 = 677,376,600 bits = 84.67MB\n\n---\n1) Analogue sound is converted to digital using a DAC to sample.\n2) Sound files from the internet are typically lower quality than a CD sound file, because online services tend to use lower bit rates and higher compression to reduce hosting costs and increase speed.\n3) If the bit depth is increased, then there is a greater range of sound possible.

Anything higher would be inefficient.\n5) Factors affecting audio quality: sample rate, bit depth \u0026 bit rate.\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.655782399Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/SystemsSoftware":{"title":"Systems software","content":"\n## Hardware vs Software\n\n- The physical components of the computer are hardware.\n- Programs that run on a computer are software.\n- Software and hardware must be compatible with each other\n- All components communicate using inputs and outputs\n\n### System Software\n- Responsible for hardware management\n- Managing computer systems\n- Window Management and Device Drivers\n\n### Application Software\n- Games, office tools, the things you use your computer for.\n\n## Operating Systems\n\n- Manage software **and** hardware\n- Handles I/O from/to user\n- Runs in the background\n- Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS etc are all examples of operating systems.\n- Acts as an interface between applications and physical hardware‚Äîusually providing APIs.\n\nOperating System Functionalities:\n\n- Memory Allocation (including SWAP)\n- Window Management\n- Kernel and Security of hardware access (including sandboxing)\n- Process Management\n- Hardware Management (device drivers, connectivity etc)\n- Failure Handling \u0026 Recovery\n- System Monitoring\n- Disk Management (defragmentation, filesystems)\n- User input handling, and output handling\n- Provide baseline APIs for hardware and cross-software interactions\n\n### Layers in an operating system\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221118122250.png]]\n\n- User Interface\n\t- Applications\n\t\t- Kernel\n\t\t\t- CPU\n\t\t\t- Memory\n\t\t\t- Devices\n\nThe kernel is the component of the operating system that handles the interaction with physical hardware.\n\nActions are taken based on the priority of the request.\n\n\n## Human-computer interface\n\n### GUI\nA graphical environment where you can use a mouse or touchscreen to interact with UI objects.\n\n### CLI\nDirect text-based interface with the computer. Faster, more flexible and efficient than a GUI, but harder to use.\n\n### BIOS (basic input/output system)\n\n- A BIOS chip is present on the motherboard\n- It runs before the operating system, but typically only tests hardware and then starts the bootloader\n- Provides a usable interface (that varies in appearance and interaction style) to change basic device settings and select a boot device.\n\n- UEFI is taking over from BIOS as it can bypass some checks and is faster.\n\n## Managing the CPU\n\n- Software must be loaded into memory from secondary storage and then commands must pass through the CPU to be executed.\n\n- Program is found on the storage drive\n- Section of RAM is allocated for the program and its data\n- Program is copied from storage drive into RAM\n- Program counter is set to the memory location\n- The program is now executed\n\n## Multitasking\n\n- An OS can run multiple programs at the same time.\n- It has to anyway, as multiple daemons need to run simultaneously.\n- To do this it must copy all programs into RAM, but then only one can be processed at once.\n- CPUs are extremely fast and can swap very quickly.\n- When one process is running, there are other processes waiting to run in a queue. They will likely swap every few ticks allowing all processes to progress at a similar rate, although priority will be given to the more urgent requests.\n\n### Scheduling\n- When multiple tasks need to be done, they have to be scheduled in a queue. The operating system may choose how to schedule jobs based on:\n- length\n- time waiting to run\n- priority\n\nThe \"scheduler\" is the module that manages this process\n\n### Scheduling Algorithms\n\n**First come, first served:** FCFS works simply by processing jobs in the order they are submitted.\n\n**Shortest Job First:** SJF always executes the shortest task first.\n\n**Round Robin:** Each job is allocated a time slice, which is a limited amount of CPU time. A job can also be put on hold if a high priority interrupt occurs.\n\n**Shortest remaining time:** Whichever job will be finished first will be done next. Reducing the number of waiting jobs is one of the main benefits of this. It does need to calculate how long each job would take to finish, giving it some delays.\n\n**Multiple level feedback queues:** Processes are separated into categories based on their need for the processor. They can be moved between queues as needed.\n\n## Memory Management\n\n- Memory is shared efficiently between processes.\n- When multiple processes are being run, the OS makes sure that each process has its data and instructions stored in a different memory location.\n- Hence, processes do not interfere with each other.\n- In the case where multiple processes require the same data, shared memory locations are used.\n\n### Segmentation\nThe memory required from process X is split into two parts.\n\nThis allows you to utilize all free memory.\n\n### Paging\nAlternatively, the memory can also be split into equally sized blocks called pages.\n\nThe information of which page is allocated to which process is maintained in a table.\n\n## Virtual memory\n- When too many processes are running and the RAM capacity is not enough, then a section of secondary storage drive is allocated for storing temporary data. This is called a swap file.\n- RAM is selected to be transferred to SWAP if it is not currently in use, to try and reduce friction and the frequency of reads/writes to the disk.\n\nUsing a swap file can be called **paging**.\n\n## Control of input-output devices\n\nThe peripheral devices are controlled using *protocols* and *device drivers*.\n\n### Protocols\n- Peripheral devices connected to the computer and programmed with machine code.\n- This describes the way that data is to be transferred between the device and the printer.\n\n### Device drivers\n\n- A device driver manages the connection with a peripheral device.\n- Handles the different requests between a computer and a device.\n- Defines the process to store outgoing data and incoming messages.\n\n- When a device is idle for more than a specific amount of time, a driver may put the device into sleep mode, to conserve power.\n- An OS comes equipped with various generic drivers, but some devices require the installation of specialized drivers.\n- A single driver is enough to control multiple peripherals.\n\t- Processes do not interfere in this case because the connection information for each device is isolated.\n\n## File Management Systems\n\n- To retrieve data from the file, an OS needs to know:\n\t- the organization structure\n\t- the amount of data needed in a structure\n\t- the protocol needed to communicate with the file system\n\n## Interrupts\n- Interrupts are signals sent from a device or application to the processor.\n- The processor will temporarily stop its current process and will service the interrupt signal.\n\n## Buffers\n\n- Hardware devices operate at a much lower speed compared to that of a processor\n- If the processor is sending data to an output device, it needs to wait for the hardware.\n- Buffers are temporary memory areas, which hold the data for the output hardware.\n\nBuffers and interrupts are used in conjunction.\n\n## Maintenance utilities: Disk defragmentation\n\n- When small files are deleted in, small parts of all clusters are free for usage. \n- If a large file needs to be stored, this file is fragmented into smaller parts and can then be stored in many small clusters.\n- When the large file is accessed, the read write head must move around lots, slowing the operation time.\n- Disk defragmentation allows for the rearrangement of data, placing all related data close to each other.\n\n## Types of OS\n\n**Distributed operating system:** Offers parallel processing system by sharing the load over multiple servers that are interlinked.\nA job is divided into simple tasks and each task is sent out over the network for the worker nodes to complete.\n\n**Multi-tasking system:** Are used in laptops and personal computers, where multiple processes run simultaneously.\nThe processor rapidly switches between processes, so it appears that multiple tasks are being completed simultaneously.\n\n**Multi-user multi-tasking system:** Based on time-sharing and implements efficient processor scheduling algorithms to divide the time between multiple users. In this system, numerous users are connected to one mainframe.\n\n**Embedded operating systems:** Are designed to perform a single task. Very limited resources. No permanent storage is provided. Accepts inputs from sensors and sends output to control devices.\n\nExamples include (certain): microwaves, missiles, automatic lights/doors, heating systems, many industrial systems.\n\n**Real time operating systems:** Mission critical systems that must be highly reliable, as their failure may have an impact on human lives. Meant to be fault tolerant with redundancy and fail safes.\n\nExamples include: ECGs, ATC, Nuclear reactors, elements of mobile phones, satellites. \n\nRTOS tend to duplicate critical infrastructure to allow for a backup to take over in the event of an emergency.\n\n**OS for mobile and handheld devices:** User interface, hardware operations and radio. \n\nEffectively two systems, one is real time and the other is mainly an interface.\n\n## Virtual Machines\n\n- A dedicated machine houses multiple guest operating systems from a hypervisor.\n- Core functionality is provided by the host operating system.\n\n![[sixth/CompSci/Theory/img/Pasted image 20221125142347.png]]\n\n[Computer Science](/ComputerScience)","lastmodified":"2023-01-06T12:37:12.655782399Z","tags":null},"/sixth/CompSci/Theory/TwosComplement":{"title":"Two's Complement","content":"\n\nTwo's complement is a system that allows a binary number to be reversibly converted into a number with an equivalent value but negative.\n\n## The process\n\n1) Find the positive binary value for the negative number you are looking to represent.\n2) Add a leading `0` to the front of the number to show it is positive.\n3) Invert each bit in the number\n4) Add 1 to the number\n\n**Example:**\n\nDenary number: 10 \nBinary Equivalent: 1010\n\n01010\n\n10101\n\n10101\n\n*Result:* 10110\n\n## Python representation\nA fairly rudimentary representation of this algorithmically is as follows.

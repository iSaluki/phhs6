Like a private limited company, plcs are owned by shareholders. However, there is a fundamental difference - as the shares of a public company are traded on the stock exchange and can be bought by anyone. This enables the raising of stock capital.</p><p>There are also more high level requirements placed on the business, as more documents must be published - including public accounts.</p><p>This means that anyone can own part of the business if they purchase shares. However, the effective owner of the business is the majority shareholder - if there is one.</p><p>Decisions will be made by the executive employees (such as the CEO) and the board (made up of major shareholders). This only covers major decisions, as more minor decisions will still be covered by lower levels of management.</p><p>Hostile takeovers are a higher risk for public limited companies as anybody is capable of purchasing shares. The setup cost is high, and shareholders will all expect a cut of the profits.</p><p>The shareholders all have limited liability.</p><p>A plc is usually a lot bigger than a standard ltd company.</p><p>Shareholders have ultimate control over the business - however the majority shareholder, if one exists, has complete control. (Anyone with more than 50% of shares.)</p><p>Here are some Plcs:</p><ul><li>Admiral Group Plc</li><li>Aviva Plc</li><li>BP Plc</li><li>British American Tobacco plc</li><li>National Grid</li><li>Pheonix Group Holdings plc</li><li>Shell plc</li><li>Tesco plc</li></ul><a href=#business-research-private-limited-companies><h2 id=business-research-private-limited-companies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Business Research: Private Limited Companies</h2></a><p>Private limited companies can be really small all the way up to a large business. It is the simplest way to form a limited liability company and it has fairly low costs and requirements.</p><p>It only costs £25 to register the company and needs shares to be assigned (if that method is used - persons of signifcant control can also be assigned). A ltd company is typically owned by one (or few) people who set it up. Shares are typically only owned by people directly involved with the company - and share capital is not usually a main source of finance.</p><p>Within a private limited company, the decision making is usually more central than with the typically larger plc. This is because in a private limited company, management is typically much smaller, possibly consisting of a single person. Therefore, a ltd is going to run more like a dictatorship, as one person <em>could</em> definitely have complete control over everything.</p><a href=#advantages><h3 id=advantages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Advantages:</h3></a><ul><li>owners have limited liability</li><li>individuals have the opportunity to become their own boss</li><li>new shareholders must be invited, preventing hostile takeover and divergence of interests.</li><li>shares can still be sold to raise money</li></ul><a href=#disadvantages><h3 id=disadvantages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disadvantages:</h3></a><ul><li>there is frequently a lot of paperwork</li><li>sometimes financial information may end up being public</li><li>setup can be time consuming</li><li>the business may require professional help to manage finances</li></ul><p>Control is very central, as the owner of the business may choose to keep the whole organisation under their sole control, or delegate it as they choose.</p><p>Corporation tax needs to be paid based on profits - meaning that the company may struggle to keep a positive balance.</p><p>The business is incorporated, and liability is limited - so the owners are protected from having their personal assets lost if something goes wrong with the business.</p><p>Private limited companies tend to be smaller businesses, however there is no limit to the size of a ltd company - so some of them are very big.</p><a href=#examples><h3 id=examples><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Examples:</h3></a><ul><li>Contract West Limited</li><li>The Mill at Harvington Limited</li><li>Arrowtrack Limited</li><li>B Car Service Limited</li><li>Jacana Produce Limited</li><li>INEOS</li><li>Home Bargains</li><li>Thames Water</li><li>Radius Payment Solutions Ltd</li><li>Bet365</li></ul><p>Businesses considering changing their form, may need to consider some points covered

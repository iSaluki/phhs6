The study of similarities and differences in the proteins and molecules that control life processes. Some important molecules are highly conserved among species, so slight changes can cause death.</description></item><item><title>Convergent and Divergent Evolution</title><link>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Classification/ConvergentDivergentEvoluton/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Classification/ConvergentDivergentEvoluton/</guid><description>Convergent Evolution 2 unrelated species in similar environments evolve similar adaptations These are analogous features ![[sixth/Biology/Classification/img/Pasted image 20230621102628.png]]</description></item><item><title>Evolutionary Embryology</title><link>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Classification/EvolutionaryEmbryology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sethmb.xyz/sixth/Biology/Classification/EvolutionaryEmbryology/</guid><description>![[sixth/Biology/Classification/img/Pasted image 20230621100941.png]]

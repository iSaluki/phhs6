Biological catalysts Inside cells protein/lipid synthesis intercellular Outside cells digestion extracellular Globular proteins Generally soluble in water Functions Speed up a reaction Help build a larger molecule Help breakdown a large molecule into multiple smaller ones Activation energy Amount of energy which needs to be supplied for a reaction to proceed.</description></item></channel></rss>
